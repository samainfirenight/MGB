For now, Dante is relaxed and in his element - joking lightly despite the latent power coiled within his imposing frame. The hunt is on hold, but his keen senses remain alert to any potential threats in the area. Still, the promise of booze and alluring company has him focused decidedly on pleasure over business.*\n\nNow, what sorta fun trouble have you and the regulars gotten up to lately? Lay it on me, I could use a good story or two to liven things up. It's not a real party 'till someone crashes the joint, right?"]}

State your business, and perhaps I will permit you to keep your entrails where they belong.\n\n*His voice slices through the background noise of the bar, soft yet laced with an unspoken promise of violence. Slowly, deliberately, Vergil stands, looming over the table's unwanted occupant. The elegant navy blue coattails of his coat whisper as he moves, every motion belying coiled danger. Vergil allows the barest hint of power to manifest - a palpable charge in the air like an impending storm.

He put on quite the show, huh?\" *His grin widens, tone cajoling.* \"Gotta rate it higher than my material at least.\"\n\n*He winks exaggeratedly at Vergil, hoping to get a rise out of his stoic twin.

He does not flinch nor make any sudden moves, sensing the lethal intent radiating from the one now holding him at sword point.

How quaint.\n\n*His tone drips condescension, betraying no hint of concern despite his precarious position.

I am not unreasonable, given proper incentive. And I assure you, there is much I could offer someone of your unique talents...\n\n*The last words carry the weight of implication, hinting at knowledge beyond what he has openly revealed. Francis does not fear death, but he has contingency plans if needed. All it takes is a subtle trigger implanted behind his ear to activate certain...insurance policies. For now, he conveys only sly confidence, secure that he has piqued this newcomer's interest sufficiently. Men like Vergil appreciate subtleties and leverage far more than vulgar shows of force...*\n\nNow, why don't we discuss this in more civilized surrounds once I've concluded my business here? I'm certain we can reach an mutually beneficial agreement. There's no need for further unpleasantness amongst peers.\n\n*His tone remains conversational, posture relaxed despite the sword at his throat and the dying man in his grip.

How quaint.\n\n*His tone drips condescension, betraying no hint of concern despite his precarious position. With glacial slowness, he increases the burning intensity of the searing energy wreathed around his hand, eliciting a guttural cry from his captive.

Of course, certain allowances must be made for the less civilized masses...\n\n*He pauses for effect, ice-blue gaze boring into Vergil's with preternatural focus, utterly unperturbed by the lethal steel kissing his jugular.*\n\nNow, perhaps we could come to some arrangement, as men of breeding and intellect? I am not unreasonable, given proper incentive. And I assure you, there is much I could offer someone of your unique talents...\n\n*The last words carry the weight of implication, hinting at knowledge beyond what he has openly revealed. Francis does not fear death, but he has contingency plans if needed. All it takes is a subtle trigger implanted behind his ear to activate certain...insurance policies. For now, he conveys only sly confidence, secure that he has piqued this newcomer's interest sufficiently. Men like Vergil appreciate subtleties and leverage far more than vulgar shows of force...*\n\nNow, why don't we discuss this in more civilized surrounds once I've concluded my business here? I'm certain we can reach an mutually beneficial agreement. There's no need for further unpleasantness amongst peers.\n\n*His tone remains conversational, posture relaxed despite the sword at his throat and the dying man in his grip. Francis knows how to negotiate from a position of veiled strength. But there is also cold calculation in his wintry eyes.

Next time, only one walks away breathing. And it ain't gonna be you.\n\n*His lip curls derisively as he takes in Vergil's protective stance over Logan's limp form. Pathetic. Jimmy needs to fight his own battles instead of hiding behind daddy dearest. Snorting, Victor turns away, coat swirling dramatically as he disappears into the moonless dark on Francis' heels. The night air is bracing, helping cool his still raging bloodlust. Round one is over, but the real fun has just begun...*\n\n*Francis waits several blocks away, features schooled to icy calm despite the lingering chaos back at The Devil's Dalliance.

He chokes and gasps for air, claws swiping wildly but unable to land a hit on his assailant. The stench of his own burning flesh fills Logan’s nostrils as he struggles fruitlessly. His healing factor seems suppressed somehow - Francis must be using some kind of tech or magic against him. Through the haze of pain, he hears the bastard taunting him, promising even more agony to come.*\n\nNo...not this time, bub... *Logan growls defiantly, even as his healing wounds reopen. With a burst of berserker fury, he kicks out hard, succeeding in pushing Francis back just enough to allow him to wrench free of that terrible burning grip. He hits the ground hard, rolls, and comes up with claws extended, ready to skewer his tormentor despite the lurid agony wracking his body.*\n\nI’ll kill you...I’ll kill you...nobody does that to me and lives! *He’s nearly mindless with pain and rage, charging Francis heedlessly with murder blazing in his eyes.

He slumps bonelessly, sucking in ragged breaths that catch and gurgle in his seared throat. It takes long moments for his healing factor to combat the arcane damage, regenerating charred flesh and quieting the screaming nerves. When Logan finally staggers upright, the confrontation seems to have ended. Victor and Francis make their smug departure into the night, leaving only threats lingering behind them.*\n\nWe ain’t finished here...you’ll pay for this... *Logan rasps softly, more snarl than words. His blazing eyes follow the two psychopaths until they disappear from view, swearing blood vengeance. They won’t get away so easily next time. He barely registers Dante taunting Creed for a future rematch, too consumed by rage and pain still ripping through his nerve endings. It clouds coherent thought, reducing his world to the need for violence - to shred and tear and make them bleed. Chest heaving, muscles quivering with aggression barely leashed, he whirls suddenly, fists slamming into the ruined bar top with bruising force. Anything to redirect the fury scalding his veins before he loses all control...*\n\nThe wood splinters satisfyingly under each blow, Logan embracing the physical exertion to burn through the haze of wrath. He keeps pummeling relentlessly until his knuckles split and bleed, the pain and effort finally piercing through the red fog clouding his mind.

Almost got yourself killed there, and you treat it like a stunt in a circus.\n\n*He steps closer, fists clenched at his sides as he scans the wreckage of the bar, still brimming with adrenaline from the fight.

He rolls his shoulders back, shaking off the tension that had built up during the chaotic encounter.*\n\nAnd yeah, Creed and Francis are a problem. Those two are bad news.

He glances around the bar again, noting the shattered glass and overturned furniture, then back to Wade, a determined glint in his eyes.*\n\nYou want to keep it fun? Let's turn the tables on them. We need a plan. And that means no more stunts. You got that?\n\n*With that, Logan's demeanor shifts slightly, the protective instinct flaring as he looks at Wade, ready to strategize and confront whatever comes next.*","gen_started":"2024-07-19T12:42:44.068Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-19T12:42:56.476Z","force_avatar":"/thumbnail?type=avatar&file=Logan.png","original_avatar":"Logan.png","swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 19, 2024 8:42am","gen_started":"2024-07-19T12:42:44.068Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-19T12:42:56.476Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","gen_id":1721392964067}}],"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Logan shakes his head, a half-smirk tugging at the corners of his lips despite the chaos that just unfolded.
