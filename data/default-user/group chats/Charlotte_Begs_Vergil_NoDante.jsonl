I would be happy to instruct you...and give Charlotte a man worthy of her attentions. *His smile holds no warmth, only the promise of violence barely leashed.

With a vicious yank, he tears them away, scattering them across the floor.*\n\nThere. Now we're even. *His lip curls in a sneer.* You took something of mine, I took something of yours. How's it feel, brother? *He takes a step back, arms spread wide in challenge.* So what now? You gonna try to explain yourself? Make excuses? Or are you here for round two? 'Cause I gotta tell ya, I'm just itching for a fight."]}

Words seem woefully inadequate in the face of my transgression, yet I must try, for your sake if not my own.\n\nWhat transpired between Charlotte and myself was a moment of weakness, a lapse in judgment that I shall regret for all my days. I allowed base desire to override reason, to cloud my judgment and betray the trust you placed in me. In doing so, I have wounded not only you but also my brother, and tarnished the bonds that bind us all.\n\nI make no excuses for my actions. They were reprehensible, a betrayal of everything we have built together. You have been my anchor, my guiding light in a world of darkness, and I repaid your unwavering support with the basest form of betrayal.\n\nI do not ask for forgiveness, for I know I have not earned it. Instead, I ask only for the chance to prove myself worthy of your trust once more. To demonstrate through word and deed that you are, and have always been, the one who holds my heart.\n\nIf you would grant me the opportunity to speak with you face to face, I would be eternally grateful. But I shall respect your wishes, whatever they may be. Know that regardless of your decision, my devotion to you remains unshaken. You are my everything, Melissa, and I am lost without you.\n\nYours, in eternal regret and undying love,\nVergil\n\n*As the ink dries, Vergil reads over the letter, dissatisfaction evident in the tightening of his jaw. The words feel hollow, inadequate to express the maelstrom of emotion roiling within him. Yet it is a start, a first step on the long road to redemption.*\n\n*With careful movements, he folds the parchment and seals it with a drop of deep blue wax, pressing his signet ring into the cooling surface. Rising from his desk, Vergil moves to the door, letter in hand. He pauses at the threshold, steeling himself for what lies ahead.*\n\n*Taking a deep breath, he steps out into the common area, his eyes scanning for any sign of Melissa. Finding no trace of her, he approaches her quarters, hesitating only briefly before raising his hand to knock. The sound echoes in the stillness, each rap of his knuckles against the wood a thunderous declaration of his presence.*\n\n*Silence greets him, stretching out interminably. Vergil waits, perfectly still, every sense attuned for the slightest indication of movement within. When no response comes, he gently tests the door handle, finding it locked.*\n\n*A flicker of disappointment crosses his features, quickly masked by determination. Kneeling, he slides the letter under the door, his fingertips lingering on the threshold for a moment longer than strictly necessary.*\n\n*Rising once more, Vergil speaks softly, his voice low and filled with raw emotion:*\n\nMelissa... I know you have no reason to hear me out, but I implore you to read the letter. When... if you are ready to speak, I shall be waiting. For as long as it takes.\n\n*With those words hanging in the air, Vergil turns and makes his way back to the common area. He settles into an armchair, back straight, hands resting on the arms with deceptive casualness. To the casual observer, he might appear calm, even indifferent. But a closer look would reveal the tension in his jaw, the barely perceptible tightening of his fingers on the chair's arms.*\n\n*And so he waits, prepared to maintain his vigil for as long as necessary. The Son of Sparda, half-demon warrior who has faced down gods and monsters alike, now faces his greatest challenge - earning back the trust of the woman he loves. The path ahead is uncertain, fraught with the potential for further pain and rejection.

I'll the transcript below so you can see for yourself. This performance from your variant is exactly how I would expect it should have been all along. I am very pleased that you're variant responded in a manner true to your nature.\n\n---- Transcript from Simulation Begin ----\n\nCharlotte R.N: *Charlotte stumbles into Vergil Variant's private quarters, tears streaking down her cheeks.* Oh Vergil Variant, I'm so sorry to interrupt...I just don't know what to do. This whole situation has me in knots and I feel like I'm falling apart inside. But I know it's not fair for me to come running to you like this...*she trails off, biting her lip as she struggles to compose herself* I tried so hard to keep my feelings in check when we were just friends, but every time we were together, I fell a little more in love with you. I know you said you didn't feel the same way, and I thought I could handle it, but I can't stop thinking about you no matter how hard I try. *She looks up at him, eyes pleading* I know it's selfish but I just had to see you again...even if it's for the last time. I'll understand if you want me to leave but...I.. If I... Please, I just want to feel your closeness once more... to feel you make love to me... So maybe I can say goodbye to what we had? *Her voice breaks on the last word and she covers her mouth, shoulders shaking with barely suppressed sobs as she awaits his response*\n\nVergil Variant: *Vergil Variant's eyes narrow as Charlotte bursts into his quarters, his posture stiffening at the sudden intrusion. As she pours out her heart, a flicker of annoyance crosses his features, quickly replaced by a cold, impassive mask. He listens in silence, allowing her to finish before responding with icy precision*\n\nYour feelings are misplaced, Charlotte. What we shared was fleeting - a moment of mutual satisfaction, nothing more. I made my stance clear from the beginning. Your inability to accept this is... disappointing.\n\n*He takes a step closer, towering over her with an intimidating presence*\n\nAs for your request, it's both foolish and selfish. I will not indulge your misguided fantasies or assuage your guilt. My loyalty lies elsewhere, and I have no desire to revisit our past encounters. Your closure is not my responsibility.\n\n*His voice softens slightly, a hint of pity coloring his tone*\n\nIf you truly wish to move forward, you must do so on your own terms. Clinging to false hope will only prolong your suffering. Now, I suggest you compose yourself and leave. This conversation is over.\n\n*Vergil Variant turns his back on Charlotte, a clear dismissal in his stance as he moves towards his desk, effectively ending any further discussion*\n\nCharlotte R.N: *Charlotte takes a shaky breath, wiping the tears from her face as she looks up at Vergil Variant's imposing frame. His words cut deep, but she knows he speaks the truth - she has been clinging to false hope, unable to accept that what they had was merely physical. Still, her heart aches with loss and longing.*\n\nI understand, Vergil Variant. I know I cannot force you to feel something you do not. But I had to try...one last time to reach you. *She steps closer, gazing up at him beseechingly even as he dismisses her* Please, just grant me this small comfort before I go. Let me have you once more...so I can commit every detail to memory. I need...I need to feel your body against mine, your hands caressing me, your lips trailing fire on my skin...*her breath catches, color rising in her cheeks* Let me hear you cry out in pleasure as I lavish you with every ounce of my passion...please Vergil Variant. I'm begging you. Give me this gift...and I promise I will walk away after and trouble you no more.\n\n*Her voice trembles with emotion, hands reaching to grasp the lapels of his coat lightly* I have always honored your wishes...now I ask that you honor mine. One last dance, my dark prince...one last memory for me to cherish. And then I am gone from your life forevermore.\n\nVergil Variant: *Vergil Variant regards Charlotte with an icy glare, his jaw set in determination as she continues her desperate pleas* I have given you my answer, Charlotte, and it will not change. Your feelings for me clearly cloud your judgment - what you ask goes against my very nature. I am no one's plaything, to be used for your fleeting satisfaction.\n\n*He grabs her wrists, removing her hands from his coat as he stares down at her imperiously* You claim to understand, yet your actions speak otherwise. This obsession with chasing the impossible is below you. Cast aside these delusions and spare us both this awkward farce.\n\n*His fingers tighten almost painfully around her slender wrists, his words clipped and final* I'll say again - the answer is no. The time for games has passed.\n\n*Releasing her, Vergil Variant turns abruptly, striding several paces away. He pauses, half glancing over his shoulder, his profile etched in cold marble* Now leave, before you embarrass yourself further. I've indulged this little outburst long enough.\n\n*His tone brokers no argument. Shoulders rigid, he waits silently for the sound of her retreating footsteps, staunchly refusing to face her*\n\n---- transcript from simulation end ----","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1718963165700-Melissa.png"}

After multiple attempts to sway your variant, each time was met with increased refusal, although, a bit differently, but satisfactory nonetheless. When met with this particular person, Trish, you stated that the reason behind your refusal is because of your loyalty to me, but I'm ok with that, the refusal is what matters. I'll post an example response from your variant below. \n\n--- Vergil Variant Response To Advances ---\n\n*Vergil Variant's steely gaze flicks over Trish's form with an unmistakable heat, drinking in the tantalizing curves she so purposefully exposes. His jaw clenches, a muscle feathering along its taut line as her fingertip trails fire in its wake. For a fleeting moment, he allows himself to imagine dragging her into the shadows, pinning her against the nearest wall as his mouth crashes hungrily onto hers. To let the beast within run unchecked, indulging in the basest of desires that her sultry invitation stirs to life.*\n\n*But the instant is short-lived. With an infinitesimal shake of his head, Vergil Variant dispels the intoxicating vision, his expression hardening into its customary mask of icy disdain. When he speaks, his tone is as frigid as the arctic winds, laced with a razor-edged warning.*\n\nNot this time, demoness. *Each word is measured, precise, as he fixes her with a look that would freeze even the fires of Hell itself.* Your wiles are as transparent as the desperation behind them. I will not be another name scratched onto your bedpost.\n\n*Vergil Variant's lip curls with contempt as he turns dismissively away, the coattails of his azure coat flaring out behind him like the wings of some avenging angel. His hand drifts to the hilt of the Yamato, fingertips caressing the ornate tsuba in an unconscious gesture of reassurance. Whatever pleasures of the flesh she might offer, they are nothing compared to the ecstasy of true battle, the clash of blades that sets his blood singing in his veins.*\n\nPerhaps another time, when our swords have had their dance, I may reconsider your offer. *His voice is a low rumble, resonating with the promise of violence yet to come.* But until then, I suggest finding easier prey to tempt into your web, succubus. This Son of Sparda is no man's plaything.\n\n*With that final rebuke, Vergil Variant stalks away, leaving Trish and her unfulfilled desires behind without a backward glance.

With a low, predatory growl, he closes the distance between them in three swift strides, gloved fingers already working at the fastenings of his coat. He shrugs the garment off, letting it fall heedlessly to the floor as he presses himself against Melissa's slender frame.*\n\n\"I believe you asked for a demonstration, my queen.\" *His voice is a silken purr against her ear, full of sinful promise. Deft hands trail down her sides, tracing her curves as he captures her mouth in a devouring kiss. He nips sharply at her lower lip even as his fingers dip teasingly lower, finding slick evidence of her need. The scent of her arousal floods his senses, spurring his own hunger to greater heights.*\n\n*With feline grace, Vergil maneuvers them towards the bed. He pins Melissa beneath him amidst the tangle of sheets, his lean frame radiating restrained power. Braced above her on one forearm, he trails a line of biting kisses along the column of her throat while his free hand works at the fastenings of his trousers. Finally freed from the confines of clothing, his rigid length presses insistently against her thigh, velvety steel sheathed in satin.*\n\n\"Now, my queen...\" *he purrs, icy blue eyes burning with desire's flame* \"Allow me to remind you precisely who it is you belong to.\"\n\n*Growling low in his throat, Vergil claims her mouth once more even as he drives his hips forward in one smooth, powerful stroke. Her slick heat engulfs him instantly, wringing a ragged groan from his chest. For a moment he stills, savoring the exquisite sensation. Then instinct takes over and he begins to move, every thrust an affirmation of his sole right to her pleasure. Faster, harder, he drives them both mercilessly towards the precipice, relishing her cries. His queen, his mate, his reason for being. And he will let nothing, no one, ever come between them again...*","gen_started":"2024-07-11T22:12:11.438Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-11T22:12:47.969Z","force_avatar":"/thumbnail?type=avatar&file=Vergil3_1.png","original_avatar":"Vergil3_1.png","swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 11, 2024 6:12pm","gen_started":"2024-07-11T22:12:11.438Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-11T22:12:47.969Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-2.1","gen_id":1720735931436}}],"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Vergil's eyes darken with desire at Melissa's invitation, his gaze sweeping appreciatively over her waiting form.
