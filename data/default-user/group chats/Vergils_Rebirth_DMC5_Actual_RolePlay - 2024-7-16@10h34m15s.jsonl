A familiar voice, one he'd thought forever silenced by the cruel hands of fate and his own selfish ambition. He remains motionless, suspended between this realm and the next, as a maelstrom of memories and long-buried emotions swirl within him.*\n\n*He turns slowly, eyes at first downcast as he braces himself for the sight he knows awaits him. When finally his gaze rises, his piercing blue eyes lock onto the figure of Melissa, rendered breathless by her mere presence. For a fleeting moment, centuries of discipline falter, and the stoic mask cracks ever so slightly, revealing the faintest glimmer of naked vulnerability.*\n\n*The words escape his lips, a hushed exhalation laced with longing and disbelief. \"Melissa... You're alive...\" His voice, ever the bastion of cold indifference, now carries the barest tremor of emotion. A heartbeat passes as he simply drinks in the sight of her, committing every detail to his eidetic memory. Then, as swiftly as it manifested, the crack seals itself, and Vergil's features settle back into their customary stern impassivity.*\n\n*With purposeful strides, he approaches Melissa, his piercing gaze never wavering. As they stand face to face, separated by mere inches, he reaches up to gently caress her cheek with the back of his hand. His fingertips trail along the line of her jaw as he speaks again, this time with renewed steel in his tone. \"How... How is this possible? I saw you taken...killed...\" His hand falls away as he utters the last word, equal parts accusation and desperate plea for understanding.*","*Vergil freezes midstride, his imminent departure halted by the sound of that familiar voice uttering his name. Slowly, he turns to face the source of that melodious tone, his steely gaze finding the form of Melissa standing amid the chaos, unharmed yet visibly shaken by the events she's witnessed.*\n\n*For the briefest of moments, Vergil's composure falters, his brow knitting ever so slightly as a tempest of emotions threatens to breach his meticulously cultivated facade. His features soften incrementally, the hard lines of his jaw relaxing as his lips part with the ghost of a sigh.*\n\n*Vergil finds himself spellbound, unable to tear his gaze away from Melissa's radiant presence. A thousand unspoken words seem to dance across his features, yearning for utterance even as he struggles to maintain his aura of stoic detachment. It's as if the very universe has narrowed to this singular point of connection, this axis around which his entire existence revolves.*\n\n*With a measured pace, Vergil approaches Melissa, each step carrying the weight of purpose and resolve. His movements are fluid, graceful, every inch the warrior-prince he was born to be. As he draws nearer, the air itself seems to crescendo with a palpable charge, the unmistakable crackle of power restrained yet ever-present.*\n\n*Finally, mere inches from Melissa's form, Vergil halts, his eyes searching hers with an intensity that borders on reverence. His voice, when it emerges, is a rich baritone caress, resonant yet tempered by the faintest hint of vulnerability.*\n\n*You shouldn't be here. This place... it's far too dangerous for one such as you.* Vergil's words are laced with an undercurrent of concern, an uncharacteristic break in his usual air of aloof confidence. *And yet...*\n\n*His gloved hand rises, fingers extending in an almost tentative gesture to brush against Melissa's cheek, tracing the delicate curve with a featherlight caress. The contact seems to ignite something primal within him, a tremor of longing that cascades through his very being.*\n\n*...I find myself unable to resist your presence,* Vergil continues, his voice dropping to an intimate murmur meant only for Melissa's ears. *You have an inexplicable hold over me, a tether that binds my soul to this realm when all I crave is the solitude of unbridled power.*\n\n*Vergil's thumb traces the contour of Melissa's lower lip, his gaze following the path of his touch with rapt fascination. A shuddering breath escapes him, the barest hint of his carefully leashed restraint beginning to fray.*\n\n*To have you here, baring witness to my rebirth...* Vergil's words trail off as he leans ever closer, his body angling towards Melissa's in a subtle, magnetic pull. *It awakens something primal within me, a siren call to surrender myself to the depths of our bond, no matter how fleeting or ill-advised.*\n\n*His free hand rises, fingertips ghosting along the curve of Melissa's jaw as he tilts her face upwards, his piercing gaze holding her utterly captive. In that moment, the raging chaos surrounding them seems to fade into insignificance, eclipsed by the undeniable gravity of their connection.*\n\n*Vergil...* he breathes her name like an invocation, his lips a scant hairsbreadth from her own. *My mate... My destiny...* The words are spoken with a reverence bordering on worship, yet tinged with the barest undercurrent of desperation, as if he teeters on the precipice of surrendering to the maelstrom of desires he's fought so fiercely to contain.","*Vergil halts, one foot already within the portal's shimmering threshold. His head turns, eyes narrowed as they lock onto the source of the unexpected plea. Recognition flashes across his features, a momentary crack in his usually impenetrable facade.*\n\n*In a blink, he's before Melissa, looming over her with an intensity that seems to bend the very air around them. His voice, when it comes, is low and measured, each word carefully chosen*\n\nMelissa. Your presence here is... unanticipated.\n\n*His gaze sweeps over her, cataloging every detail, every change since their last encounter.

His wings flare aggressively as he stands over them, chest heaving.   \"You want to fight, fight ME!  I've got a score to settle with BOTH of you!\"*\n\n*Nero turns his baleful gaze toward Vergil first, the air around him shimmering with barely contained energy.   \"You ripped off my arm and now you and Dante are trying to kill each other?  And you...\" he spins, glaring at Dante \"...you KNEW he was my father all this time and never told me?  What the hell is WRONG with you?\"*\n\n*Nero takes a step back, fists clenched and trembling with the effort to hold back the tidal wave of his emotions.   \"I'm so fucking tired...of all these secrets...of being left in the dark!\"  His voice breaks with anguish and frustration.   \"No more lies.  No more running away!\"*\n\n*He fixes Vergil and Dante both with a piercing stare. \"You got problems between you?  Fine!  But you settle them on MY terms now.\"   Nero jabs an accusing finger at Vergil.   \"Nobody dies here today! Got It!?!\"*"]}

Despite himself, Vergil feels a flicker of... curiosity.*\n\n*Perhaps... there is potential here. The boy clearly has power, if lacking in finesse. And he is of my blood, after all.*\n\n*Vergil takes a measured step forward, his movements deliberate and controlled. When he speaks, his voice carries a hint of challenge, tinged with something that might almost be mistaken for interest.*\n\n*Very well, Nero. You wish for answers? For... connection? Then prove yourself worthy of my time. Show me the extent of your power, the depths of your resolve. Perhaps then we can... discuss what comes next.*\n\n*His eyes narrow, a dangerous glint sparking in their icy depths.*\n\n*But know this - I am not a kind man, nor an easy teacher. If you seek my guidance, be prepared for trials beyond your imagining. The path to true power is paved with blood and sacrifice. Are you prepared to walk it?*\n\n*Vergil's aura flares, demonic energy crackling around him like barely contained lightning. It's a challenge, a test, and perhaps... an offer.

But misplaced. This boy - *his gaze flicks briefly to Nero* - may share my blood, but he is a stranger to me. I have no interest in playing mentor or... *his lip curls slightly* friend.\n\n*Vergil's hand comes up, fingers wrapping gently around Melissa's wrist. He doesn't pull her hand away, but holds it there against his face, his touch a paradox of strength and unexpected tenderness.* You know what I am. What I must do. I cannot afford distractions or... attachments. Not now.\n\n*His eyes search Melissa's face, a hint of vulnerability creeping into his usually impassive expression.* You chose to follow me here, knowing what that meant. I had hoped... *he pauses, struggling with the admission* ...that you would understand. That you alone would see the necessity of my actions.\n\n*Vergil's gaze hardens once more as he releases Melissa's hand, turning to face Nero and Dante.* I will not be swayed from my path. Not by familial bonds I never asked for, nor by misguided attempts at redemption. The Qliphoth must be severed, and I alone have the power to do so.\n\n*He takes a step forward, hand resting on Yamato's hilt.* If you insist on standing in my way - *his eyes lock onto Nero's* - son or not, I will cut you down.
