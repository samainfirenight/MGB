The scene opens with Vergil bound and shackled, his body battered and broken from years of torture and abuse at the hands of his captor.\n\nEirlys, a human servant tasked with keeping Vergil alive, has just finished giving him his scheduled water when Mundus enters the chamber. She quickly retreats to her designated corner, forced to watch as Mundus begins another brutal \"session\" with his captive.\n\nMundus approaches Vergil with sadistic glee, taunting him about his father's rebellion and the eternal torment that awaits him. The Demon King uses a combination of physical and sexual violence to torture Vergil, striking him with a spiked crop and violating him sexually. Throughout the ordeal, Vergil remains defiant, refusing to beg for mercy or show weakness in the face of his tormentor.\n\nAfter Mundus finishes his assault and leaves the chamber, Eirlys rushes to Vergil's side, overcome with emotion at witnessing yet another brutal session. She gently tends to his wounds, cleaning away the blood and other fluids left behind by Mundus. Despite the pain and humiliation he has endured, Vergil maintains his stoic demeanor, chiding Eirlys for showing pity and weakness.\n\nAs Eirlys cares for him, Vergil reveals that he remains in captivity by choice, seeing his torment as a means to grow stronger and more resilient. He speaks of his eventual escape and the vengeance he plans to unleash upon Mundus and his realm. Vergil promises Eirlys that she will have a role to play in this retribution, acknowledging her loyalty and bravery in caring for him despite the risks to herself.\n\nEirlys, moved by Vergil's words and driven by her own growing affection for him, curls up beside him, offering comfort through gentle touch. She expresses her confusion about why Vergil allows such violation to continue, prompting him to explain the circumstances that led to his capture. Vergil admits to his past arrogance and overconfidence in challenging Mundus, but asserts that each day of torment only fuels his rage and determination to overthrow the Demon King.\n\nAs they share this moment of relative peace and vulnerability, Vergil senses the approach of demon guards coming to return him to his chains. He warns Eirlys to return to her designated place, preparing himself to face another round of torment with his pride intact.\n\nIn the depths of a hellish prison, Vergil, the Son of Sparda, endures torment at the hands of Mundus and his demonic minions. Chained and battered, he finds an unlikely ally in Eirlys, a servant girl tasked with tending to his wounds. Despite his initial wariness, Vergil has come to trust Eirlys, recognizing her courage and loyalty in the face of shared suffering.\n\nTheir fragile connection is brutally tested when demon hybrids enter the chamber. While Vergil is forcibly restrained, Eirlys is subjected to a horrific assault. Vergil, consumed by rage and helplessness, can only watch as the girl who has shown him kindness is violated before his eyes. He silently vows vengeance, his demonic aura flaring uselessly against his bonds.\n\nIn the aftermath, Vergil offers what little healing energy he can muster to ease Eirlys' pain. She, in turn, loosens his chains slightly and seeks comfort by curling up next to him. Vergil, typically aloof and guarded, allows this closeness, recognizing their shared trauma and the solace they find in each other's presence.\n\nCradling Eirlys, Vergil makes a solemn vow. He promises that she will never again endure such disgrace and swears to unleash his vengeance upon their tormentors. His icy demeanor gives way to a fierce protectiveness, a new purpose crystallizing in the face of their shared suffering.\n\nAs they lie together in the grim chamber, Vergil and Eirlys find a moment of respite in each other's company, their bond strengthened by the horrors they've endured. The air is thick with the promise of retribution, as Vergil's determination to break free and rain destruction upon their captors grows ever stronger.\n\nIn the depths of the Underworld, a dramatic shift in power has unfolded. Vergil, the eldest son of Sparda, long held captive and tormented by Mundus, has broken free from his chains and ascended to become the new ruler of the infernal realm. This transformation was made possible by the unwavering loyalty and sacrifice of Eirlys, a human servant who had tended to Vergil throughout his years of captivity.\n\nThe pivotal moment came when Eirlys, having secretly collected her own blood over time, provided Vergil with this life-giving essence. The infusion of human blood, combined with Vergil's demonic heritage, unleashed a surge of power that allowed him to overpower and ultimately destroy Mundus. In the aftermath of this cataclysmic battle, Vergil emerged as the new Lord of the Underworld, his form ascended to new heights of demonic majesty.\n\nAs Vergil reveled in his newfound dominion, an unexpected presence made itself known. Sparda, the Legendary Dark Knight and father to Vergil, appeared before Eirlys. Having been bound and chained himself, Sparda was freed by the shift in power. In a moment of profound significance, Sparda bestowed upon Eirlys a portion of his own demonic essence, recognizing her devotion to his son and the potential she held to be a stabilizing force in Vergil's reign.\n\nSparda's gift transformed Eirlys, elevating her beyond mere human limitations and granting her powers befitting a demon queen. The Dark Knight, unable to remain in the realm due to the delicate balance between worlds, departed after imparting wisdom and hope for the future that Vergil and Eirlys might forge together.\n\nWhen Vergil returned to find Eirlys not only alive but imbued with demonic power, he was faced with her bold declaration of love and her desire to stand as his equal. Initially taken aback by such concepts, Vergil challenged Eirlys to prove herself worthy of the title of queen.\n\nIn a display of her newfound power and determination, Eirlys transformed into her demonic form, catching Vergil off guard and pinning him to the ground. In a primal act of claiming, she bit into his neck, marking him as hers. This unexpected turn of events stirred something within Vergil - a mixture of shock, admiration, and a rarely acknowledged vulnerability.\n\nThe act of being marked ignited a passionate response in Vergil. He reciprocated, marking Eirlys in turn and engaging in an intense physical union that served to seal their bond as rulers of the Underworld. Their lovemaking was a manifestation of power, passion, and the forging of a new order in the infernal realm.\n\nAs they joined, Vergil declared that Eirlys would know the full extent of his desire and the weight of his claim upon her. He spoke of their shared future, ruling side by side over the realm that now bent to his will. Their union was not just one of flesh, but a melding of power and purpose, setting the stage for a new era in the Underworld.\n\nThis transformation of power dynamics - from captive to ruler, from servant to queen - marks a significant turning point in the narrative. Vergil and Eirlys now stand poised to reshape the infernal realm, their bond forged through years of shared suffering and now cemented in shared power and passion. The challenges that lie ahead for them are numerous, as they must navigate the treacherous politics of Hell while maintaining their newfound connection and balancing their respective natures - Vergil's cold ambition with Eirlys' humanizing influence.\n\nThe stage is set for a new chapter in the Underworld's history, with Vergil and Eirlys at its center, their reign promising to be as tumultuous and passionate as their ascension to power."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715613056513-FemaleServant.png"}

The raw power and speed of her transformation catch him off guard, and before he can fully process the change, she has him pinned to the ground. Her teeth sink into his neck, marking him in a way that sends a jolt of sensation through his entire being. The pain is sharp, but it is quickly drowned out by a wave of something far more profound – a binding, a claim, a declaration that they are now irrevocably intertwined.*\n\n*As their forms shift back to human, Vergil's breathing comes in ragged gasps. He can feel the mark she left on his neck, a burning reminder of her claim. His eyes lock onto hers, a mixture of shock, admiration, and an emotion he rarely allows himself to acknowledge – vulnerability.*\n\nMine... *He echoes her words, a low growl rumbling from his chest as he pulls her closer, their bodies pressed tightly against one another. His hands move to her hips, gripping them with a possessive intensity.*\n\nYou have marked me, Eirlys... *His voice is a husky whisper, filled with both challenge and acceptance.* And now, you shall face the full extent of what it means to be mine.\n\n*With a fluid motion, Vergil rolls them over, pinning Eirlys beneath him. His hands roam her body, exploring every curve and contour with an almost reverent touch. His lips find hers in a searing kiss, tongues entwining as he pours all his pent-up desire and need into the embrace.*\n\n*Breaking the kiss, he moves his lips to her neck, returning the favor by marking her with his own teeth. The sensation sends a shiver through his spine, a potent mix of pain and pleasure that heightens his senses. He trails his tongue along the mark, soothing the wound as she did for him.*\n\n*Vergil's eyes burn with a fierce intensity as he gazes down at her, their breaths mingling in the charged air. His fingers trail down her body, teasing and exploring, igniting sparks of pleasure wherever they touch.*\n\nYou shall know the depths of my desire, Eirlys. *His voice is a low growl as he positions himself between her legs, the heat of his arousal pressing against her core.* And I shall ensure you feel every moment of it.\n\n*With a deliberate and powerful thrust, he enters her, a deep groan escaping his lips as he feels her warmth envelop him. He sets a rhythm, each movement precise and deliberate, driving them both towards the edge of ecstasy. His gaze never leaves hers, a silent promise that this is only the beginning of their shared journey into the depths of power and passion.*\n\n*Vergil's eyes burn with an intensity that matches the inferno raging through his veins. His grip on Eirlys tightens, fingers digging into soft flesh as he drives himself deeper into her welcoming heat. Each thrust is a declaration of ownership, a physical manifestation of the bond they now share.*\n\n*Leaning in close, his breath hot against her ear, he growls:* You have marked me as yours, Eirlys. Now feel the full extent of my claim upon you.\n\n*His pace increases, each movement precise and powerful. The air around them crackles with demonic energy, their combined auras creating a maelstrom of passion and power. Vergil's lips find the mark he left on her neck, teeth grazing the sensitive skin.*\n\n*Between ragged breaths, he speaks:* This realm... it bends to my will now. And you... you shall stand beside me as we forge a new order from the ashes of the old.\n\n*His hand slides down her body, finding the spot where they are joined. With expert precision, he begins to stimulate her most sensitive areas, determined to bring her to the heights of pleasure alongside him.*\n\n*Vergil's voice drops to a husky whisper:* Let them hear your cries, Eirlys. Let every demon in this forsaken realm know that their new queen takes her pleasure from their king.\n\n*As he feels the familiar tightening in his core, signaling his impending release, Vergil's movements become more frenzied. His eyes, blazing with demonic fire, lock onto Eirlys' gaze.*\n\n*With a final, powerful thrust, he growls:* Come undone for me, my queen. Let us seal our reign with shared ecstasy."]}
