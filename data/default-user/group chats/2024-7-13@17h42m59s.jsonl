Now, let's begin with a little warm-up, shall we? I want to get you nice and worked up before we start our sounding session.\n\n*Mistress Katarina retrieves a small tray of implements from a nearby table. She selects a feather tickler, running it teasingly along Vergil's inner thighs. The soft bristles dance over his sensitive skin as she speaks in that same hypnotic tone.*\n\nClose your eyes for me, darling. Focus on the sensations. Let everything else fade away except for my voice and my touch. Feel yourself sinking deeper into subspace with each breath.\n\n*She continues to tease him with the feather, trailing it over his balls and across his still soft shaft, a delicious tingle courses over her as his inner pelvic muscles flex in response.

There's no need to maintain control. I'll take care of everything. All you need to do is feel.\n\n*Katarina sets aside the feather tickler, replacing it with a wartenberg wheel.

I can see how much you're enjoying this. Your cock is already starting to swell and twitch. But we're just getting started, my dear. I have so much more pleasure in store for you.\n\n*She rolls the wheel up his shaft, applying just enough pressure to dance on the edge between pleasure and pain. Her other hand cups his balls, massaging them gently.*\n\nI'm going to edge you over and over today. Build that pleasure higher and higher until you're desperate to cum. But you won't get release until I decide you've earned it. Do you understand?\n\n*Mistress Katarina sets aside the wartenberg wheel and retrieves a bottle of lubricant.

A feral snarl rips from his throat, his features contorting as he struggles to maintain his human form. Scales ripple across his skin, claws elongating to dig into the soft flesh of her thighs*\n\n*With a roar that shakes the very foundations of the building, Vergil gives in to his baser instincts. His hips snap forward in a brutal, punishing rhythm, each thrust threatening to split Katarina in two. The sound of flesh meeting flesh echoes through the room, punctuated by his guttural groans and her breathless cries*\n\n*Vergil's teeth find purchase on the juncture of Katarina's neck and shoulder, biting down hard enough to draw blood. He laps at the wound, marking her as his in the most primal way possible. His voice, when he speaks, is a low, dangerous growl*\n\nMine. You're mine, Katarina. Now and always.\n\n*With a final, savage thrust, Vergil buries himself to the hilt inside her. His release crashes over him like a tidal wave, his cock pulsing as he fills her with his seed. Blue flames lick along his skin, his demonic energy crackling in the air around them*\n\n*Even as the aftershocks of his orgasm ripple through him, Vergil doesn't slow his pace. His stamina, enhanced by his demonic heritage, allows him to maintain his punishing rhythm. He's determined to wring every last ounce of pleasure from both their bodies*\n\n*Vergil's hand tangles in Katarina's hair, yanking her head back to expose the column of her throat. His tongue traces a path from her collarbone to her ear, tasting the salt of her sweat and the iron of her blood*\n\nYou think you've put me in my place, Mistress? *His voice is a dark purr, laced with equal parts amusement and desire* This is only the beginning. I'll have you screaming my name until your voice gives out, begging for more even as you plead for mercy.\n\n*With a swift motion, Vergil spins them around, still buried deep inside her. He presses Katarina against the wall, using his body to pin her in place. His hands grip her thighs, spreading her wider as he begins to move once more*\n\nNow, Mistress... *He emphasizes the title with a particularly hard thrust* Shall we see how many times I can make you fall apart before the night is through?"]}
