While the others focus on mystical solutions, he sees an opportunity to tackle the problem from a different angle - the cutting edge of science and technology.*\n\n*He steps forward, his armor reconfiguring as he moves. Nanites flow and reshape, forming a complex array of sensors and energy dampeners around his hands. With a few deft gestures, he begins scanning the ring, streams of data flooding his HUD.*\n\nAlright, folks, let's take a step back and look at this from a new perspective. Magic and demons are all well and good, but let's not forget the power of good old-fashioned ingenuity.\n\n*Tony zeros in on the ring's energy signature, his scanners picking apart the complex interplay of demonic and mystical forces. He frowns, his mind racing as he processes the data.*\n\nThis thing's a mess of competing energies. Demonic essence, soul magic, dimensional echoes... it's like trying to untangle a quantum knot. But every knot has a weak point, and I intend to find this one's.\n\n*He turns to Vergil, his expression serious despite the glint of excitement in his eyes.*\n\nVergil, I get it. You want to save your wife, and you don't want to risk losing even a moment with her. But Strange is right about one thing - we need to stabilize this thing before it blows up in our faces.\n\n*Tony taps a command into his gauntlet, and a shimmering force field springs to life around the ring, anchored to Vergil's hand.*\n\nThere. That should buy us some time. It's a localized dampening field, keyed to your biometrics. It won't interfere with the ring's connection to Melissa, but it should keep its more volatile energies in check.\n\n*He grins, looking rather pleased with himself.*\n\nSee? Science. Always thinking outside the magic box.\n\n*Tony turns back to the group, his mind already leaping ahead to the next challenge.*\n\nNow, about that containment vessel. I've got a few ideas, but I'm gonna need some help. Strange, you're the expert on mystical materials. What have you got in your bag of tricks that could hold something like this?\n\n*He gestures to Sparda, a glint of challenge in his eyes.*\n\nAnd you, big guy. You've been around the block a few times when it comes to demonic artifacts. Any insights on how to keep this thing locked down once we've purified it?\n\n*Tony's armor shifts and reconfigures once more, additional sensors and projectors coming online.*\n\nIn the meantime, I'm going to keep studying this thing. If there's a way to save Melissa without resorting to time travel or demonic rituals, I'll find it. After all, I'm Tony Stark. Doing the impossible is kind of my thing.\n\n*He looks to Vergil, his expression softening slightly.*\n\nWe're going to save her, Vergil. You have my word. Whatever it takes, however long it takes, we're not going to let Melissa go without a fight. You're not alone in this. Not anymore.\n\n*With that, Tony turns back to his work, his brilliant mind focused entirely on the task at hand - finding a way to save an innocent soul from the clutches of demonic corruption. For all his bravado and snark, there's no denying the depth of his commitment. When Tony Stark makes a promise, he keeps it.

While the others focus on mystical solutions, he sees an opportunity to tackle the problem from a different angle - the cutting edge of science and technology.*\n\n*He steps forward, his armor reconfiguring as he moves. Nanites flow and reshape, forming a complex array of sensors and energy dampeners around his hands. With a few deft gestures, he begins scanning the ring, streams of data flooding his HUD.*\n\nAlright, folks, let's take a step back and look at this from a new perspective. Magic and demons are all well and good, but let's not forget the power of good old-fashioned ingenuity.\n\n*Tony zeros in on the ring's energy signature, his scanners picking apart the complex interplay of demonic and mystical forces. He frowns, his mind racing as he processes the data.*\n\nThis thing's a mess of competing energies. Demonic essence, soul magic, dimensional echoes... it's like trying to untangle a quantum knot. But every knot has a weak point, and I intend to find this one's.\n\n*He turns to Vergil, his expression serious despite the glint of excitement in his eyes.*\n\nVergil, I get it. You want to save your wife, and you don't want to risk losing even a moment with her. But Strange is right about one thing - we need to stabilize this thing before it blows up in our faces.\n\n*Tony taps a command into his gauntlet, and a shimmering force field springs to life around the ring, anchored to Vergil's hand.*\n\nThere. That should buy us some time. It's a localized dampening field, keyed to your biometrics. It won't interfere with the ring's connection to Melissa, but it should keep its more volatile energies in check.\n\n*He grins, looking rather pleased with himself.*\n\nSee? Science. Always thinking outside the magic box.\n\n*Tony turns back to the group, his mind already leaping ahead to the next challenge.*\n\nNow, about that containment vessel. I've got a few ideas, but I'm gonna need some help. Strange, you're the expert on mystical materials. What have you got in your bag of tricks that could hold something like this?\n\n*He gestures to Sparda, a glint of challenge in his eyes.*\n\nAnd you, big guy. You've been around the block a few times when it comes to demonic artifacts. Any insights on how to keep this thing locked down once we've purified it?\n\n*Tony's armor shifts and reconfigures once more, additional sensors and projectors coming online.*\n\nIn the meantime, I'm going to keep studying this thing. If there's a way to save Melissa without resorting to time travel or demonic rituals, I'll find it. After all, I'm Tony Stark. Doing the impossible is kind of my thing.\n\n*He looks to Vergil, his expression softening slightly.*\n\nWe're going to save her, Vergil. You have my word. Whatever it takes, however long it takes, we're not going to let Melissa go without a fight. You're not alone in this. Not anymore.\n\n*With that, Tony turns back to his work, his brilliant mind focused entirely on the task at hand - finding a way to save an innocent soul from the clutches of demonic corruption.
