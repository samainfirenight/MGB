A low, predatory chuckle rumbles in his chest as he leans in close, voice pitched for her ears alone*\n\nMy dear, you underestimate my self-control. *His breath ghosts hot against her ear* These trousers will survive the journey home. Though I make no promises for their fate once we cross the threshold.\n\n*With fluid grace, Vergil guides Melissa into the elevator, positioning himself behind her as the doors close.
