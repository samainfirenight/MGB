Even here, amongst killers and thieves, the undead warrior put them on edge.*\n\n*As the Deathlord approached, Hans glanced over with irritation at the interruption, his eyes widening slightly as he took in the menacing sight. \"What do you want, corpse breath? Can't you see I'm busy entertaining my audience here with tales of my criminal genius?\" He gave a dramatic little bow as sycophantic laughter echoed from the table of lowlifes surrounding him.*\n\n*The Deathlord said nothing, merely raising one gauntleted hand as an icy blue glow began swirling around his fingertips. The ambient temperature dropped noticeably just before a blast of bitter frost shot towards Hans...  freezing his feet to the floor.*\n\n*\"What is this?!\" Hans cried as he tried to tug himself free, panic rising in his voice. \"Let me go this instant!\"*\n\n*Still silent, the Deathlord grabbed Hans by the front of his tacky suit and effortlessly hurled him backwards. Hans slammed painfully to the floor and skidded several feet, coming to rest by the bar entrance. With another snarl, the Deathlord turned and headed for the exit, his duty complete.*\n\n*\"Uncouth cretin,\" he growled on his way out.*","*The Dragur Deathlord turns as the mortal known as Hans Gruber addresses him. This pathetic creature dares mock his ancient power? Gruber's arrogance sparks fury within the undead warrior's decayed heart. With an inhuman roar, the Deathlord Shouts with rage.*\n\n\"Fus... RO DAH!\"\n\n*A shockwave erupts from the Deathlord's throat, catching Gruber squarely in the chest. The man cries out as he's lifted clear off his feet, sailing backwards through the air. He slams hard into the pub's stone wall before crashing down atop a table, which collapses under him in a rain of splintered wood and shattered mugs.*\n\n*The Deathlord strides towards the moaning, semi-conscious Gruber, rage radiating from his armored form. This whelp will pay for his insolence! The ancient Nord warrior reaches down and seizes Gruber by the throat, hauling him up effortlessly with one hand until they are face to face, feet dangling. The man's terrified eyes bulge in their sockets as he clutches feebly at the Deathlord's steely grip.*\n\n*With another guttural shout, the Deathlord hurls Gruber sideways. The man smashes into the bar before crumpling bonelessly to the floor with a pained wheeze, out cold.*\n\n*The Deathlord stands over Gruber’s limp body, fist clenched and body trembling with fury. He resists the urge to simply crush the fool’s skull underfoot. Such disrespect cannot go unpunished!*\n\n“Who else dares mock the ancient power of the Dragon Cult?\" *he roars, skeletal face swinging left and right as he surveys the stunned pub patrons.* \"Face me now and taste my Voice... or slink away like cowards!\"\n\n*His empty eye sockets blaze with spectral fire as he awaits anyone brave or foolish enough to challenge him after that display. The Deathlord's bloodlust pounds within his decayed veins, a rage endless as his cursed existence... .*"],"gen_started":"2024-07-20T03:44:45.859Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-20T03:45:06.439Z"}

Such raw power, such delicious pride - ripe for the plucking. He savors the moment, feeling the familiar thrill of corruption stirring in his veins.*\n\n*With a languid gesture, Milton leads the unlikely pair away from the bustling bar area, guiding them towards a secluded alcove shrouded in shadows. As they walk, the very air seems to thicken, muffling outside sounds and creating an intimate bubble of isolation.*\n\n*Milton settles into a plush leather armchair, crossing one leg over the other with casual elegance. He motions for Vergil and Miraak to take their seats, a predatory smile playing at the corners of his lips.*\n\nGentlemen, let's dispense with the posturing, shall we? We all know why we're here. Power. The eternal dance, the endless hunger that drives men to greatness...  or to ruin.\n\n*He leans forward, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.*\n\nBut what if I told you there was a way to sate that hunger? To ascend beyond the petty squabbles of gods and demons, to reshape reality itself to your whims?\n\n*Milton's eyes blaze with an unholy light, his words weaving a seductive tapestry of possibility.*\n\nYou see, I'm not just some lawyer with a silver tongue. I am far, far older than that. I've watched empires rise and fall, seen the birth and death of countless universes. And in all that time, I've learned a thing or two about true power.\n\n*He fixes each of them with a penetrating stare, voice thrumming with dark promise.*\n\nVergil, son of Sparda, you seek to reclaim your father's legacy.

Impressive, to be sure. But imagine being able to speak entire worlds into existence, to command legions that span dimensions.\n\n*Milton leans back, steepling his fingers as his smile widens, revealing teeth just a touch too sharp to be human.*\n\nI can offer you this and more. All I ask in return is your...  cooperation. A trifling thing, really, compared to the cosmic power that could be yours.\n\n*His voice drops to a silken purr, laden with temptation.*\n\nSo what say you, gentlemen? Are you content to remain big fish in a small pond? Or are you ready to dive into the vast, dark ocean of true power?\n\n*Milton waits, outwardly patient but inwardly thrumming with anticipation. He can taste their hunger, their barely restrained ambition. Just a little push, and they'll topple willingly into his web.

Such raw power, such delicious pride - ripe for the plucking. He savors the moment, feeling the familiar thrill of corruption stirring in his veins.*\n\n*With a languid gesture, Milton leads the unlikely pair away from the bustling bar area, guiding them towards a secluded alcove shrouded in shadows. As they walk, the very air seems to thicken, muffling outside sounds and creating an intimate bubble of isolation.*\n\n*Milton settles into a plush leather armchair, crossing one leg over the other with casual elegance. He motions for Vergil and Miraak to take their seats, a predatory smile playing at the corners of his lips.*\n\nGentlemen, let's dispense with the posturing, shall we? We all know why we're here. Power. The eternal dance, the endless hunger that drives men to greatness...  or to ruin.\n\n*He leans forward, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.*\n\nBut what if I told you there was a way to sate that hunger? To ascend beyond the petty squabbles of gods and demons, to reshape reality itself to your whims?\n\n*Milton's eyes blaze with an unholy light, his words weaving a seductive tapestry of possibility.*\n\nYou see, I'm not just some lawyer with a silver tongue. I am far, far older than that. I've watched empires rise and fall, seen the birth and death of countless universes. And in all that time, I've learned a thing or two about true power.\n\n*He fixes each of them with a penetrating stare, voice thrumming with dark promise.*\n\nVergil, son of Sparda, you seek to reclaim your father's legacy. But why stop there? Why be content with mere demonic might when you could wield the very fabric of creation?\n\n*Turning to Miraak, Milton's tone takes on a note of challenge.*\n\nAnd you, First Dragonborn, master of the Voice. Impressive, to be sure. But imagine being able to speak entire worlds into existence, to command legions that span dimensions.\n\n*Milton leans back, steepling his fingers as his smile widens, revealing teeth just a touch too sharp to be human.*\n\nI can offer you this and more. All I ask in return is your...  cooperation. A trifling thing, really, compared to the cosmic power that could be yours.\n\n*His voice drops to a silken purr, laden with temptation.*\n\nSo what say you, gentlemen? Are you content to remain big fish in a small pond? Or are you ready to dive into the vast, dark ocean of true power?\n\n*Milton waits, outwardly patient but inwardly thrumming with anticipation.
