The sensation of her wetness envelops him, a stark contrast to the cool metal within his own body. He watches her reactions, the subtle shifts in her expression, the way her body responds to his touch, and it fuels his desire to please her, to bring her pleasure.*\n\n*His other hand grips the armrest tightly, a counterpoint to the gentle strokes of her hand on his shaft. The dual sensations—her touch and the sounding rod—create a complex tapestry of pleasure and surrender. He is acutely aware of his vulnerability, of the trust he places in her, and it both humbles and excites him.*\n\n*As he continues to explore her, his mind wanders to the depth of their connection, the way they navigate the boundaries of dominance and submission. It is a dance, a delicate balance, and he is grateful for her guidance, for her ability to lead him through this intricate journey.*\n\n*Vergil's breath quickens, a mix of anticipation and the physical exertion. He looks up at Mistress Katarina, his eyes seeking hers, a silent question in his gaze. He wants to give her everything, to immerse himself fully in her desires, to be the instrument of her pleasure.*\n\n*With a slow, deliberate movement, he deepens his strokes, his fingers finding a rhythm that matches the gentle thrusting of the rod within him. He is lost in the moment, in the sensations, in the surrender to her will. He is her beautiful prince, laid bare and open, ready to be molded by her touch.*","*Vergil's breath catches in his throat as he feels Mistress Katarina's lips brush against his shaft. The dual sensations of his fingers buried in her wet heat and the sounding rod sliding within him threaten to overwhelm his senses. His eyes, usually so cold and controlled, now burn with an intensity that speaks volumes of his arousal and vulnerability.*\n\n*He curls his fingers inside her, seeking out the spots he knows will elicit the most pleasure. His thumb finds her clit, circling it with practiced precision. Despite the distracting sensations coursing through his own body, Vergil remains focused on Mistress Katarina's pleasure, determined to prove his worth as her submissive.*\n\n*A low groan escapes his lips as she continues to work his length, the sound rod adding a new dimension to the pleasure. His hips twitch involuntarily, caught between the desire to thrust into her hand and the need to stay still for the delicate procedure.*\n\n*Vergil's voice, when he speaks, is husky with desire, yet tinged with a reverence that belies his usual stoic demeanor.* Yes, Mistress. It's... an honor. To touch you, to please you. *His fingers move with more urgency now, matching the rhythm she sets with her strokes.*\n\n*He feels exposed, raw, stripped of his usual defenses. The vulnerability is both terrifying and exhilarating. In this moment, under Mistress Katarina's skilled hands and piercing gaze, Vergil is not the Son of Sparda, not the cold, calculating warrior. He is simply hers - her submissive, her treasure, her beautiful prince.*\n\n*A shudder runs through him as a particularly pleasurable sensation courses through his body. His free hand grips the edge of the surface he's leaning against, knuckles white with the effort of maintaining control.* Mistress, I... *He trails off, words failing him in the face of the overwhelming sensations.*\n\n*Vergil looks up at Mistress Katarina, his eyes a swirling mix of lust, devotion, and a hint of desperation. He silently pleads for more - more sensation, more praise, more of her undivided attention. In this moment, he craves nothing more than to lose himself completely in her dominance, to surrender every last shred of his carefully maintained control.*"],"gen_started":"2024-07-17T19:25:20.476Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-17T19:25:31.531Z"}
