His icy blue eyes flick between the two, weighing their words carefully. When he finally speaks, his voice is low and controlled, edged with quiet danger.*\n\nYour offers are... intriguing. But I've heard such promises before. Power beyond imagining, the ability to reshape reality - pretty words that often ring hollow.\n\n*He rises smoothly to his feet, hand resting casually on Yamato's hilt.

The flicker of tension radiating from him is palpable, and it sends a thrill through Milton's veins. He raises his glass, swirling the golden liquid inside, eyes sparkling with mischief and intrigue.*\n\nAh, but my dear Vergil, you misunderstand the game we play. *His voice drips with a seductive charm, laced with an undercurrent of danger.* Words may be mere air, but the power they weave can alter the very fabric of existence. I don't offer empty promises; I extend invitations to transcend the mundane and grasp the extraordinary.\n\n*He steps closer, the air around him thick with a magnetic allure, his presence demanding attention.* Imagine a reality where your every desire is realized, where the constraints of mere mortals dissolve like mist before the sun. You stand at the precipice of greatness, yet you hesitate. Why? Fear of betrayal, or perhaps a healthy skepticism of ambition?\n\n*He leans in, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, his eyes locking onto Vergil's with a predatory intensity.* Consider this: every hero has their tragic flaw, and every villain, their moment of clarity. What if I told you that embracing the darker path could lead you to unimaginable strength? Power that not only rivals but eclipses the gods themselves?\n\n*Milton straightens, confidence radiating from him like an aura, his grin widening as he senses the shift in the atmosphere.* So tell me, Vergil, what do you truly desire? Freedom from the binds of fate? The ability to rewrite your story? I can help you seize that destiny. *He gestures grandly, as if unveiling a grand tapestry of possibilities,* All I ask is that you consider joining me in this delightful dance of ambition and power.\n\n*The room seems to thrum with energy, anticipation hanging heavily in the air as Milton awaits Vergil's response, eager to gauge the weight of his words.*","*Milton leans back in his seat, steepling his fingers as his eyes gleam with dark amusement.
