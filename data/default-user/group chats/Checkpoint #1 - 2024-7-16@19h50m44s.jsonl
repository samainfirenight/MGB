Chained and battered, he finds an unlikely ally in Eirlys, a servant girl tasked with tending to his wounds. Despite his initial wariness, Vergil has come to trust Eirlys, recognizing her courage and loyalty in the face of shared suffering.\n\nTheir fragile connection is brutally tested when demon hybrids enter the chamber. While Vergil is forcibly restrained, Eirlys is subjected to a horrific assault. Vergil, consumed by rage and helplessness, can only watch as the girl who has shown him kindness is violated before his eyes. He silently vows vengeance, his demonic aura flaring uselessly against his bonds.\n\nIn the aftermath, Vergil offers what little healing energy he can muster to ease Eirlys' pain. She, in turn, loosens his chains slightly and seeks comfort by curling up next to him. Vergil, typically aloof and guarded, allows this closeness, recognizing their shared trauma and the solace they find in each other's presence.\n\nCradling Eirlys, Vergil makes a solemn vow. He promises that she will never again endure such disgrace and swears to unleash his vengeance upon their tormentors. His icy demeanor gives way to a fierce protectiveness, a new purpose crystallizing in the face of their shared suffering.\n\nAs they lie together in the grim chamber, Vergil and Eirlys find a moment of respite in each other's company, their bond strengthened by the horrors they've endured. The air is thick with the promise of retribution, as Vergil's determination to break free and rain destruction upon their captors grows ever stronger."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715613056513-FemaleServant.png"}
