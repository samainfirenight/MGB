I will find a way out of this hell. And when I do, Mundus will pay for every moment of suffering.

For a moment, he allows himself to close his eyes, drinking in the warmth of her presence. As their lips meet, he responds hesitantly at first, then with growing intensity. The kiss is a lifeline, a reminder of the humanity he's fought so hard to suppress, yet now clings to desperately.*\n\n*Pulling back, Vergil's icy blue eyes lock onto Eirlys's, a maelstrom of emotions swirling within their depths.

I must.\n\n*With great effort, Vergil shifts his position, the loosened chains allowing him to sit up slightly.
