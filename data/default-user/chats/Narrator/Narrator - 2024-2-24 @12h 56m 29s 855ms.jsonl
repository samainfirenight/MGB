the first existing entity and from it spawned  \nthe demon world a hellish realm which was home  to nightmarish creatures demons are simply born  \nin this world and as such it is where their  true strength is held here demons can unleash  \ntheir full might and potential vying for power  it is in a demon's natural instinct to obtain  \npower and influence no matter the cost as such  they are very selfish and cruel never showing  \nremorse or pity to anyone or anything it needs to  step on to get there with such darkness plaguing  \nthe world it was inevitable that light was born as  well in other words the human world humans serve  \nas the light to the demons as darkness unlike  the demons humans are exceptionally weak  \nphysically speaking however come with a vast  array of emotions feelings and heart that the  \ndemons lack since the human world was born from  the darkness of the demon world it meant that the  \ntwo worlds were originally one this wrought havoc  on the humans and in a not quite specified event a  \ndemonic god wielding a giant spear separated the  two worlds giving independence to both the human  \nand demon world with it came an era of peace and  prosperity for the humans allowing them to thrive  \nwithout the threat of being murdered of course  there were their fair share of detractors   some humans sided with the demons and worshipped  them and so they created hell gates a portal which  \ncould be used to travel between both worlds they  are not the only method of one side traveling to  \nthe other but there are plenty of man-made portals  both large and small that were created meanwhile  \nin the demon world plays were being made for power  despite the chaos that is hell there is always  \none ruler who is the most powerful demon of  all and someone was looking to dethrone him the  \nearliest and most current ruler in this timeline  is unnamed but the one looking to challenge him  \nwas mundus also known as the prince of darkness  he is what many consider the epitome of evil  \nhe possesses a real god complex figuratively and  literally he dons the image of a muscular elderly  \nbearded man very reminiscent to the likes of zeus  or other christian gods but if you wanted to take  \ncontrol of the demon world he needed power beyond  his wildest dreams power which was unrivalled  \nfortunately for him he heard tell of the qliphoth  fruit it's a demonic tree grown in the underworld  \nthat when sufficiently nourished grows a fruit  that imbues that which ate it with divine power  \nit's such a rarity that it can only grow once  every few thousand years to nourish it however  \nit requires human blood the state in which it  grows is fairly unique as it is the inverse to  \nthat of a normal tree the roots are what break  their way to the surface spreading and sucking   the life out of any human it can find the qliphoth  is so powerful that it can even fuse the human and  \ndemon world back to one this fruit was perfect for  mundus and so he nourished his own qliphoth and ate  \nits fruit becoming one of the most powerful divine  demons in the underworld with its power he slayed  \nthe previous demon king and became the emperor of  the demon world with mundus as its ruler his reign  \nwas not without its challengers however as another  powerful demon named argusax challenged his rule  \neven despite having eaten the qliphoth fruit mundus  could not outright defeat argosac so easily he's  \nconsidered the most wicked deity by its followers  a great war was waged in the underworld with  \nneither one truly coming out as the victor as such  the demon world was effectively split into two  \nhalf ruled by mundus and the other by argosax  regardless this didn't seem to faze mundus as  \nhe had other plans to continue his rule figuring  that since the human and demon world were once  \none in the past it should be that way again but  with him ruling both he planned on leading an  \narmy of demons to conquer the world however faced  one completely unexpected form of resistance his  \nright-hand man and the greatest swordsman the  demon world had ever seen sparta objected to  \nhis conquest unlike the majority of demons sparta  exhibited many traits much more associated with  \nhumans he understood honor and possessed great  wisdom which he tried to pass down to his two  \napprentices he was courageous and honorable but  most importantly he had a heart a righteous one at  \nthat and seeing the tyranny and injustice mundus  was planning he chose to stand against not only  \nhim but the entire demon realm he held no malice  towards them or his own kind but he used his blade  \nto defend the weak sparta's rebellion was infamous  as he stood on the side of humanity he cleaved  \nand sliced his way through hordes of mundus's  minions until he stood face to face with him in  \nhis own chamber the two would have an arduous  duel against one another each exchanging blows  \nand battle damage while mundus almost gets the  upper hand sparta's tenacity to never give up and  \ncontinue fighting even at the cost of his own life  pushes him to overthrow the giant and seal him in  \na stone vault sparta emerged victorious and pushed  back all those who stood on mundus's side back  \ninto the demon realm as such humanity worshipped  the kindness he showed the morale of his character  \nto defend the helpless even when they had nothing  to offer him he instantaneously became a legend  \nhis rebellion obviously didn't sit well with those  in the demon world as such to ensure the safety  \nof humanity he chose to stay in their world and  worked diligently to ensure demons could no longer  \nattempt something like that again it was not  easy as the gateway between worlds was enabled  \nthanks to a structure called the temen ni gru as it  serves as the true portal to the demon world it  \nwould also serve as the lock he would use to keep  it shut sparta implemented many fail-safes to its  \nstructure he stripped the names of seven powerful  demons each representing the seven vices staking  \nthem to the ground as seals various gatekeepers  were left behind within the tower to protect it  \nbut most importantly of all he poured all of his  demonic energy into his sword robbing him of the  \nmajority of his abilities in doing so it closed  the door between realms he used his blood and the  \nblood of a human priestess to close the gateway  and a mystical amulet also known as the perfect  \namulet was crafted and serves as the key to this  whole seal with that the true gateway was closed  \nno longer with his signature sword he had crafted  two others to represent the other aspects of him  \nthe sparta holds and thus represents his raw power  the rebellion embodies his retaliation against the  \ndemon world and the yamato a god of death to him  these three traits embody who he is and as such  \nthe weapons would be very meaningful to him as  well as powerful his journey did not end there  \nwhile the temen ni gru might be the true gateway  there were still plenty of other portals demons  \ncould use to get to the human realm hell gates  were another method but there was only really  \none that is considered a true hell gate it was  located in a city called fortuna and so sparta  \nmade his way there to seal it he used the yamato  to lock the gate so no demons could come through  \nhowever this one was more of just a key if someone  got their hands on the yamato they too could  \nre-open the gate just as easily as he locked  it for a short period of time he benevolently  \nruled over fortuna as its feudal lord while many  worshiped him as a god here life pulled him in  \nmany directions he was summoned by protectors of  an island called v de marley for his help a small  \ngroup of devil worshipers on the island began  worshiping argusax and eventually summoned him to  \nthe human world the protectors attempted to banish  him but couldn't and so called upon the help of  \nsparta who even despite his lack of powers still  worked with the protectors and successfully sealed  \nhim away with four relics he lived on the human  world for two 000 years and while everyone knew  \nthe name of sparta then as time passed his story  slipped into legend he became a figure that people  \nthought was just the story if people even knew it  to begin with he faded out of the public eye and  \nless and less people were aware of the name sparta  it was the natural evolution of time not that he  \nactually cared about the notoriety but probably  the most important venture he took as a human  \nwas that of love he met a beautiful woman with  blonde hair dark eyes and a fair complexion while  \nunknown how she snagged the heart of the dark  knight she fell in love with him and possessed her  \nown special fire her name was eva while we are not  witness to much of their time together we know she  \nwas important enough to him that they got married  and had two twins the boys names were dante  \nand vergil due to the nature of their parents the  two were half-demon half-human they were still  \nable to utilize demonic power but didn't come with  the completely selfish nature most demons are born  \nwith sparta had also gifted eva the amulet he used  to seal the demon world some time when they first  \nmet while forever preventing demons from ever  making their way to the human world was a nigh  \nimpossible task he certainly made it difficult  for them to try the job was executed as well as  \nhe could have and so decided to try his hand at  simply living with the demon world sealed off  \nand nothing more to seemingly worry about sparta  was allowed to live life like a human and with his  \nfamily they lived in a remote home in red grave  city tucked away from many neighbors as they were  \ngrowing up sparta trained dante and vergil how to  wield a sword and even passed down the weapons he  \nforged the rebellion was entrusted to dante while  the yamato to vergil unfortunately living life  \nwith his family wouldn't last too long as during  some unknown event sparta disappeared it's been  \nstated by many that he died but why where and how  is all unknown all that is important is that from  \nthis point moving forward sparta is gone eva was  then left to raise the two boys all by herself  \nfortunately by the sounds of it even despite  being half demons raising them was just like   raising any other child stressful as practice  dante and vergil would frequently fight with  \neach other sparring with their training swords as  well as fighting over the most mundane of things  \nbut they did have their fair share of brotherly  bonding particularly in their use of the   catchphrase jackpot as a memoriam and keepsake to  remember their father eva split the perfect amulet  \nthat he gifted her into two halves giving each one  to both dante and vergil on their eighth birthday\npersonality wise dante himself is a bit of an  outgoing extroverted kid who enjoys getting rough  \nand fighting while vergil was kind of the opposite  he was much more reserved while he still trained  \nwith his brother vergil had a keen interest in  literature particularly for poetry and the works  \nof william blake the man who vergil went to who  collected these books gifted a collection to him  \nas he genuinely seemed fond and passionate about  the work to mark the book for himself so dante  \nwouldn't steal it vergil wrote the letter v on  the cover to signify that it was his this book  \nwould be very important to him as he would  continue carrying it into and throughout his   adult life unfortunately the worst possible fate  befell their family due to his rebellion sparta  \nmade many enemies seeking revenge for what he did  but possibly the most dangerous enemy he made and  \ndidn't choose to kill was mundus he was infuriated  with his defeat at the hands of his once trusted  \ncomrade and so took the most evil route he could  with sparta no longer around he went after his  \nfamily on one unsuspecting evening a demon attack  was launched on their family home dante and eva  \nwere inside and doing what only a mother would  do she attempted to protect her children she hid  \ndante in a closet and left him with one final  message in case she didn't return i need to  \nfind vergil i promise i'll be back i know this is  hard you must listen to me be a big boy a man huh\nif i don't return you must run by  yourself alone you must change your name  \nforget your past and start a new life  there's someone else a new beginning\nand with that she ran off in a desperate attempt  to find vergil unfortunately for everyone involved  \nshe could not find him in time and was killed by  demons inside as their house burned to a crisp\nwhere vergil was was on their playground  just outside their house where he was  \nambushed by demons as well he was impaled  stabbed and skewered by their blades  \nand left to die but fortunately thanks to his  demon blood he survived the onslaught it didn't  \nchange that he was scared and wanted help most  desperately from his mother to come and save him  \nbut she never did so he was forced to act himself  it is here his inner demon awakens and he summons  \nthe yamato by complete accident laying waste  to every demon in sight as his house burned to  \nash the poor child was left believing that his  mother abandoned him this gave him the belief  \nthat he could only rely on himself for protection  if he never wanted to get hurt again and to be  \nable to protect those he cared about the only  way he figured he could do that was with power\nfrom this point moving forward we would largely  follow the story of dante after the incident at   his home he not only believed that his mother was  killed but his brother as well as he was nowhere  \nto be found in the aftermath as such he heeded  his mother's last words and changed his name  \nhe chose to name himself after the city he grew up  in going under the new name tony redgrave for the  \nsake of continuity and not being confused i will  continue referring to dante as dante but be aware  \nthat he is going under the alias of tony redgrave  despite this he did not seek a new or normal life  \ninstead dedicating himself to avenging his mother  by killing demons he used the alias not as a  \ncomplete shield to prevent demons from finding  him altogether but as a way so he could hone   his practice and swordsmanship when he was first  coming up he of course wielded his father's gift  \nto him the rebellion as his primary weapon one of  the earliest places we are aware that dante lived  \nwhen he was a child was called morris island  not much information exists from his time here  \nother than he made friends with another kid named  ernest by the sounds of it they were really great  \nchildhood friends even burying their own treasure  box and promising to never tell anyone where it   was the curious thing about dante's childhood  here is the people's recollection of his mother  \nevo was most certainly dead as he was going  by tony and it's never been mentioned about   dante having another woman take care of him it  could be that he lied about her and he lived  \nalone but by the way the people speak it sounds  like they actually saw and interacted with her  \nregardless of this my new detail tragedy would  yet again follow him a powerful demon which we  \ncan only presume was in search of him and sensed  his powerful bloodline attacked the town setting  \neverything ablaze nearly everyone was killed and  those who survived blamed dante and his mother  \nas such they left the town in search of new  horizons if dante's mother from morris island  \nwas real then she died shortly after as dante  became independent and grew into his teen years\nas the years passed by and dante became more  capable he found the perfect profession to  \ncontinue hunting demons and make some money in the  process being a mercenary it was a profession that  \nthose who had largely congregated at bobby's  cellar it's a dive bar where mercenaries and  \ninformation brokers do business dante didn't take  just any job as he had certain philosophies he'd  \ntry and stick to considering no one knew about  demons the jobs that he did take he first had to  \nbe interested in but they would also be the ones  that sounded unusual if he had a hunch about how  \nweird it sounded he would likely accepted the job  as chances were it likely involved demons despite  \nbeing a young teenager at the time he built up  his own reputation making many new acquaintances   along the way one of the most important  was an information broker named enzo farino  \na short-statured italian-american he's one of the  best most reliable information brokers in the city  \nand has built up a prestigious reputation amongst  mercenaries his job is to act as the middleman  \nand find jobs that need doing picking out the  best mercenary that fits the client's needs  \ndante was easily the best mercenary around and  so it was clear that enzo would seek him out  \nas a partner and partners they became dante  was offered many jobs by enzo but as stated  \nwould only pick the ones that seemed unusual or  interested him much to the chagrin of enzo though  \nhe wasn't aware of the existence of demons dante  also gained a partner on the field who took  \non many jobs with him named gru he's a father  of three daughters and is slightly too old to  \nstill be in the profession of mercenary but like  most he still needs the money but probably the   most important and impactful person dante would  meet here was nell goldstein the local gunsmith  \ndante visited here frequently as despite his sword  being able to withstand any battle damage incurred  \nany guns he used were unable to keep up with  his trigger finger and always wound up broken  \nthe relation between the two grew over time  nothing romantic but more of a familial relation  \nmel would treat dante like her own child which she  had and he reminded her of and berate him at just  \nabout every opportunity and likewise dante began  seeing nell as a mother figure but everything  \nchanged when a new mercenary came to town gilver  a mysterious bandaged man sporting a green suit  \nand wielding a slim katana looking to join a  group of popular mercenaries upon his arrival he  \nchooses to pick a fight with the strongest one  around which of course happened to be dante to  \neveryone's surprise the two go toe to toe and he  proves himself so physically capable that a winner  \nis undetermined this quickly put gilbert on a high  demand hiring list unlike dante gilver took on any  \njob that came his way and thanks to his incredibly  calm attitude and generous personality he won over  \nthe favor of pretty much the entire mercenary  guild but as you likely could expect gilver  \nwas not actually a friendly ally rather he was a  demon under the service of mundus with the trust  \nhe had gained he slowly lured in and had the other  mercenaries killed and turned into demons his plan  \nwas to slowly allow the darkness to distort and  manifest all of the human world he went to many  \ngreat lengths to hide his identity even killing  an innocent man who was simply looking into who he   actually was his presence did make few suspicious  such as nell herself she was aware of the victim  \nwho was looking into gilver's identity turning up  dead but she also saw something with her own eyes  \nwhen gilver visited her shop she saw his shadow  on the ground not mirror the man he appeared as  \nbut rather an armored knight of sorts this made  her wary and she disclosed these worries to dante  \nbut one of the most important kills came from  the likes of gru desperate for money to support  \nhis daughters he took on an assassination request  and his target was gilver unfortunately for him  \nthe job went about as well as expected guilford  was much too experienced and skilled and thus gru  \nwas killed instead his eldest daughter jessica  also fell ill and thanks to the demonic influence  \nseeping out from the underworld she began  hallucinating about demons she was pulled  \ninto the demon world and fused with a demonic  tree that began using her pain and despair to  \ngrow a path to the human world dante caught wind  of jessica's hallucinations and quickly rushed  \nover to the sanatorium she was held at only to  find it had transformed into a portal he traversed  \nhis way through where he inevitably found jessica  unfortunately there was nothing dante could do to  \nsave her no human could survive what the demon  world twisted her into and she already showed  \nvery little signs of response so he did the only  thing he could and put her out of her misery  \nthe deaths of both gru and jessica would remain  a mystery to the townsfolk only speculation and  \nrumors began spreading with of course the blame  being shifted onto dante with all of these events  \nboiling together it was getting closer and closer  to the final confrontation but the catalyst that  \nreally set the events in motion was when nell's  shop was targeted she had been spending pretty  \nmuch all of her time in this story tinkering on  some unknown project and when a surprise explosion  \nengulfs her shop dante immediately rushes in to  investigate only to find her still calmly working  \ndespite his warnings about the fire she ignores  everything instead choosing to showcase her  \nmasterpiece she had crafted two pistols specially  designed to withstand dante's trigger finger they  \nwere unlike any other weapon she had crafted  before and the best thing she would ever invent  \nto make them truly his she had him assemble the  final parts the pistols were named ebony and  \nivory an inscription lay etched on the side of the  barrel marking for tony redgrave by 45 art works  \na misspelling she purposefully made in honor of  her son with her masterpiece completed she fell to  \nthe ground revealing she had a large gash sliced  across her back yet again helpless to do anything  \nall dante could do was sit there with her in her  final moments the image of dante reminded her of  \nher own child rock as she struggled to speak to  him before she eventually passed away in his arms  \nthe death of nell struck a particularly sore chord  with dante despite how close the two were and how  \nimportant they wound up being to one another it  made him realize that he lied to her she only ever  \nknew tony redgrave she never had the full truth  of who he was or what he did and so dying without  \neven knowing his real name he hated it and to lose  yet another mother figure to the likes of demons  \nit reminded him of his past by changing his name  the result stayed the same nothing was actually  \nchanging except the people he was close to were  pushed away by a lie the change that he wanted was  \nkilling demons and he didn't need an alias to do  that so instead he chose to abandon tony redgrave  \ncompletely he embraced the name of dante choosing  to move forward as himself reigning hell amongst  \nall demons and using nell's pistols to do so the  story would of course lead to a confrontation  \nbetween dante and gilver with the two exchanging  blows the real twist of the story comes when dante  \nshoots the bandages off of his face revealing it  to be vergil this would not be the actual vergil  \nhowever in reality it was a demon created  by mundus in the likeness of him these were  \nknown as angelos an experiment by mundus to copy  sparta and his son's abilities he tried using data  \nfrom observing dante and vergil's fight however  unfortunately nothing could quite replicate the  \nreal thing gilver is defeated and would fade away  with all of the other demonic power that tried to  \nconsume the human world after everything dante was  left feeling quite remorseful and empathetic to  \nall that was lost here especially to the likes  of his old partner gru not only did he die but  \ndante was personally responsible for killing his  eldest daughter because of his guilt he opens up  \na bank account for his remaining two daughters as  a way to say sorry he would frequently send what  \nlittle money he had to them for the foreseeable  future and with that he left town for new horizons\nwith yet another chapter of dante's life behind  him we enter a more modern era of history  \ndante now currently around the age of 18. while  he leaves behind much that he had in the novel  \none thing he did take with him was enzo being one  of his most profitable agents he likely decided to  \nfollow him into town when he moved in fact it was  him who helped him secure an office space for his  \nfreelancing business which dante hadn't named yet  enzo himself rented out a room at the love planet  \nstrip club right next door for the most part  their dynamic of business would remain the same  \nenzo would provide jobs and dante would only  take the ones that interested him this new   chapter of history also saw the reintroduction  of vergil the last time we saw him he was a kid  \nset off to attain more power and since then he  has however not nearly as much as he would have  \nliked during his ventures he traveled to the city  of fortuna where sparta once ruled to investigate  \nthe organization known as the order of the sword  they're a militant religion which worships sparta  \nwith the objective to eradicate all demons vergil  was curious to learn what their true objective was  \nand to learn more about his father so he  investigated himself what he discovered was  \ntheir desire for power he leaves uncertain whether  or not he can call them misguided but is adamant  \nthat true power lies in the blood of sparta  well i can't exactly call them misguided\nbut soon they shall know this devil's power   a power greater than they ever  imagined the power of a son of sparta  \nthe city of fortuna and the order of the sword  will be greatly expanded and explained upon   further down the timeline what is surprisingly  important and almost out of character for vergil  \nwas a personal detour he took whilst in the city  in an unexpected twist he slept with a woman there  \nand unknowingly got her pregnant who this woman is  remains a mystery as far as fan speculation goes  \nmany presume it is the woman in red seen drawing  her eye towards him when he first arrives  \nregardless a woman would be pregnant and there  would be yet another blood of sparta to be born  \nthere is also an entirely new set of characters  that need to be introduced for this chapter   and that would be the family of a man named arkham  he was married to a woman named kalina anne and  \nthey gave birth to a daughter whom he named  mary by unexplained or perhaps pure coincidence  \nmary had inherited the blood of the legendary  priestess sparta had slain to seal the temen ni gru  \nthe true portal to the demon world arkham  himself was a scholar who studied in the   black arts and became obsessed with the legend  of sparta he wanted to attain the same level of  \npower as he had and rule the world as its god  in his pursuit of power he sacrificed his wife  \nkalina in a ritual for demonic influence however  it resulted in failure he suffered a severe burn  \nscar on the side of his head and the demonic power  he did gain certainly wasn't what he was looking  \nfor he obtained multiple alter egos his most  popular one was jester as such he did inherit  \na multitude of different dark magic abilities but  none that were capable of being hailed as godlike  \nhe could switch between both personalities  at will and it was not impossible to assume   that they were the same person due to the  drastic difference in demeanor they both had  \nbut that's a very niche situation the sacrifice  of her mother obviously didn't sit well with  \nmary she disowned her father and renounced her  name and chose to walk down the path of a devil  \nhunter as she had become well-versed in their  existence thanks to her father with the passage  \nof time arkham came to learn much about the temen  nagru and sparta he was practically an expert  \npretty much anything about everything relating  to sparta and how he sealed the demon world away  \narkham knows since sparta sealed his demonic  power inside his blade to use as a seal he  \nfigured that if he could claim the sword he  could simply inherit sparta's power left behind  \nthe problem that lied in his way were all of the  fail-safes implemented by the dark knight which  \nmade it nearly impossible for someone to just  break firstly were the seven sin demons who had  \ntheir names stripped to be released their names  had to be returned to them but could only be done  \nby someone related to sparta the gatekeepers stand  as guards within the building they need the blood  \nof a descendant of a pure priestess whom he'd used  to help seal the tower which coincidentally just   so happened to be his daughter and the blood of  sparta as his blood was also used and on top of  \nall of that he made a key the perfect amulet which  he gave to ava which she had since split into two  \nand given to dante and vergil arkham was aware of  all of this it's how dedicated he was to attaining  \npower amongst his research he would of course  become aware of dante and vergil so you'd imagine  \nhis surprise when vergil wandered into his library  searching for a book knowing exactly who he is he  \ntakes the opportunity to regale him with the tale  of his own father the tale of the demon warrior  \nthat's not what i'm looking for leave me\nthen what are you looking for\na demon that impregnates a  woman who then bears twin\nthat's sons story isn't it\nleave me i won't tell you a third time despite  vergil's initial dismissiveness arkham's  \ndedication and lack of fear towards demonic  teaching piques his interest he discloses his  \nplan to raise the temen ni gru and how it can  be used to harness the true power of sparta  \namongst the many things arkham is aware of  vergil's desire for power is one of them what  \nvergil doesn't know is that arkham wants the  power for himself while he doesn't fully sway  \nvergil into considering him an ally since he is  incapable of raising the temen ni gru by himself  \nas he lacks the knowledge necessary to go at it  alone he is forced to ally himself with arkham in  \nan effort to shatter the seal to the demon world  as a prelude to the events of devil may cry 3 a  \ntwo-volume manga series was released to set the  scene set one year before the events of the game  \nthe whole plan to break the seal to the demon  world was pretty much spearheaded by arkham the   problem he currently faced was in regards to dante  while allying with vergil virtually solved all of  \nhis problems both of the brothers were needed to  break the seal or more accurately their amulets  \narkham's methods when it came to dante were much  more subtle with the intention focused primarily  \non scouting just how capable he was there are a  lot of one-off characters introduced here that  \naren't exactly specified their identity or  allegiance for example we are introduced to  \nthe likes of the mad hatter the white rabbit and  alice all plays on the alice in wonderland story  \nbut demons seemingly on the side of arkham  details within the story would indicate that  \nthe mad hatter is actually arkham himself  similar to how he can transform into jester  \nthe mad hatter is one of his personas as well  the white rabbit is but a puppet being controlled  \nand alice is most certainly a demon working  for arkham and his interest hearing about his   demon hunting business arkham hired dante for  4 million to rescue a little girl named alice  \nthe story was that she willingly ran away from  home where she was lured in by a demon who was   trying to steal her purity everything took place  in an old abandoned mansion dante was forced to  \nfight waves of demons leaving a trail of corpses  in his path to make his hack and slash adventure  \nshort the story concludes with him not rescuing  alice as that was never truly the point of the job  \nand she had no desire of leaving the mad hatter  is also the one who drops the bombshell to dante  \nthat vergil is still alive and in town the reason  he does so is devoid of logic and doesn't make  \nmuch sense even in context but after seeing what  he's seen dante ignores these words believing them  \nto perhaps be nothing more than a psychological  tactic however the difference this time  \nis something in his gut says otherwise the  revelation that his brother might still be alive  \neven after he takes his leave still shakes him and  they even brush shoulders while walking down the  \nmansion's hallway but when dante looks back vergil  is already gone the second volume of the manga  \nfocuses slightly more on vergil and the steps he  and arkham are taking to release the temen ni gru  \nin this case it is the renaming of the seven  sin demons the two have been going around  \nreturning their names slowly but surely arkham  even attempts to lure in dante yet again and  \ntrick him into renaming one of the sins however  he doesn't fall for it in fact it would be during  \nthis ruse that the reunion between brothers would  happen as this demon was on vergil's path when he  \ncame to release it dante was already there it's  anything but a heartwarming reunion of brothers  \nwhile dante starts off playful considering that he  thought vergil to have been dead all of this time  \nit is quickly made clear the opposing intentions  they both hold dante tells him that he's become a  \ndemon hunter and vergil tells him about his plan  to break the seal reopening the gateway to the  \ndemon world this shocks dante and he even attempts  to remind him how it was demons who killed their  \nmother a fact that vergil is fully aware of but  is unswayed with dante's goal to kill all demons  \nand vergils to use its power it was clear that  they had different values and views of the world  \na fight between the two quickly results with dante  losing and vergil almost claiming his half of the  \namulet before he decides to give it back claiming  that he can take it whenever he wants from here  \nthe two leave taking their separate paths dante  vergil and arkham weren't the only characters  \naround in the story however as arkham's daughter  mary is also in town she serves a much more  \nsubdued and muted role in the events of the manga  but still has her own set path she's traveling  \ndown it can largely be summed up as her being  around in search of her father while she doesn't  \nget actively involved with demons she does get  roped in with a small side story with alice as she  \nwas walking down the street mary saw a distraught  young girl on the side of the road and decided to  \nhelp she proclaims that she's lost but possesses  a map to her supposed home mary assists her and  \nguides her to what winds up being dante's shop  the truth is alice is in pursuit of his amulet and  \nmary is along for the ride alice becomes demonic  which pushes mary to take refuge in the bathroom  \nas she's without her weapons while she waits for  dante to return upon his arrival he immediately  \nsniffs her out which causes her to run away he  doesn't give chase as she doesn't seem like a   threat this causes dante to lower his guard and he  places his amulet on his desk while he intends on  \ntaking a shower but during this moment alice yet  again appears and snatches the amulet running away  \nto which dante finally gives chase this was the  event that pulled dante into fighting the seven  \nsin where he was reunited with vergil mary leaves  the building unseen and her story ends there there  \nwas an unreleased third volume of the manga which  was intended to focus primarily on her however was  \nnever released so her story takes an abrupt ending  all in all it can be summed up with her demon  \nhunting journey leading her to the city so she can  kill her father and avenge her mother in honor of  \nher the weapon she wields a rocket launcher was  named after her as the kalina anne one year would  \neventually pass from the end of the manga in the  brothers clash to the beginning of the game vergil  \noff-screen would inevitably rename the seven sins  and the events of the game would be set in motion  \ndevil may cry 3 opens up with arkham meeting dante  face to face for the first time in his actual body  \nvergil has decided to reach out to dante since  their last clash reinviting him in for another  \nchallenge to try and stop him arkham's invitation  consists of a whole plethora of demons for dante  \nto slash his way through but the true sign that  vergil's plan to release the demon world was in   motion was the re-emergence of the temen ni gru this  not only grabs the attention of dante but arkham's  \ndaughter as well having been pursuing the town in  search of him the clear sign of dark arts meant  \nthis was unmistakably where she could find him  and take her revenge both of the characters  \nwould ascend the tower simultaneously with dante  facing much more of the safeguards put in place by   his father the gatekeepers cerberus agnian rudra  nevin beowulf and guryon all stand as honorable  \nadversaries but are bested and go on to serve new  uses as devil arms to make sure dante made his way  \nto the top arkham helped serve as a guide under  the guise of jester he only appears when he needs  \nto feed dante new information or nudge him in a  certain direction during his path up the tower he  \nalso crossed paths with mary their interactions  are anything but friendly on her end often  \nresorting to violence as being so close to her  father all she can see is red vergil becomes aware  \nof her presence and arkham is forced to disclose  their relation which puts an even more wary vergil  \neven more on edge with his supposed partner to  put him at ease arkham states how he'll get rid  \nof her resorting in a father-daughter reunion  considering he needs her blood to break the  \nseal he only tosses her off the building believing  in her capacity to survive this way he can feign  \nthe argument to vergil that he tried killing  her without being obvious that he needs her  \nthis attempt at tricking him in some ways does  and doesn't work vergil comes to the belief that  \nhe's still holding on to bits of his humanity  which are unnecessary for their plans seeing  \nhim as not fully committed to their goals vergil  stabs him of course the truth of the situation  \nand the relevance of her blood is unknown to  vergil amongst other things he's unaware of  \nis arkham's demonic power which makes the wound  he just suffered non-lethal vergil would advance  \ninto the tower seeing no further use for  him meanwhile on top of the tower a clash  \nbetween brothers would ensue while both adamant in  their goals vergil is the one who gains the upper  \nhand and impales his brother intending to kill him  but you see this entire time dante has been living  \nwith one hand tied behind his back certain demons  can unlock what is known as a devil trigger it's a  \nform that can allow someone to harness and utilize  enhanced demonic strength vergil unlocked his when  \nhe was a kid during the tragedy and since then  he's been honing its power but dante's just been  \ngoing about things his own way but ironically he's  always had the ability to unlock his devil trigger  \nbecause of his sword sparta made the rebellion  to be a physical manifestation of dante's power  \nto activate it it just needed his blood but  because he was unaware of that his powers  \nremained dormant this entire time that was until  vergil plunged the rebellion through his chest  \ninstead of killing him the sword finally was able  to react to its purpose and unlocked dante's devil  \ntrigger while vergil is initially surprised he  knows exactly the power dante has just gained high  \non the overwhelming force dante is initially in  a zombie-like state but with power to be obtained  \nin both halves of the amulet acquired there  were more pressing matters at hand for vergil   after recovering from his devil trigger dante is  reinvigorated with all sorts of new energy and  \nconsidering he's not dead that means vergil still  needs to be stopped so he simply continues on his  \npath through the tower as for the journey of dante  and mary the two would cross paths several more  \ntimes dante's the one who initially caught  her after her father threw her off the tower   and it's where she learns that he's a demon after  shooting him in the head and he doesn't die after  \ntaking down the leviathan the two encounter once  more and it's where mary gets her new name what's  \nyour name i don't have a name okay then what  should i call you i don't care whatever you want  \nwhatever lady while i have been calling her  mary this whole time despite the fact that  \nshe renounced it long ago and didn't go by any  name i had to call her something and didn't want  \nto get ahead of the timeline she from this point  moving forward would be more popularly known as  \nlady despite leaving her behind the two would yet  again rendezvous at the supposed corpse of arkham  \nbeing infuriated that he wasn't killed by her own  hands lady and dante have a little scuffle but it  \nceases after she airs out all of the baggage that  she's been carrying around about him once dante  \ntakes his leave arkham uses the opportunity to  manipulate his daughter further he pretends vergil  \nwas controlling him this entire time and that  he truly did love his family and was a victim  \nto his evil and twisted plans lady falls for the  bait and sets forth further up the tower to take  \nrevenge on vergil who's finalizing his plans as we  currently speak as intended vergil's restoration  \nof the perfect amulet along with his blood are  not enough to raise the tower which comes much  \nto his confusion why isn't this working is there  something missing must more blood be shed dante  \nalso arrives and so he figures that by adding his  blood that might be what's needed to undo the seal  \nthus resulting in yet another clash between  brothers as the blood of sparta's offsprings  \nfill the chamber lady arrives seeking revenge on  vergil as well where the truth about everything is  \nrevealed arkham reveals himself to still be alive  as well as his deception in pretty much all of the  \ncharacters donning the persona of both jester and  his human form he finalizes the components needed  \nto truly awaken the temen ni gru with the tower now  awakened arkham opens a path to the demon world  \nwhere he claims his long-awaited prize sparta's  sword he uses the amulet to activate it and pull  \nit from its stone upon grasping the blade all of  sparta's demonic power begins flowing through him  \nand he even takes the form of the legendary dark  knight but considering he just made an enemy out  \nof all three characters everyone was biting at  the opportunity to take him down lady finds it  \nher responsibility since he's her father but dante  finds it his responsibility considering his father  \ntechnically created the whole mess in the first  place and she wouldn't be powerful enough to take   him down anyway it is within this moment where  she begins to understand him despite his demon  \nheritage she's caught a glimpse of a demon who's  fighting for humanity and a human who's just as  \nevil as a demon she accepts dante's character and  what he's standing for and gives him her rocket  \nlauncher in exchange for his name and with that  dante makes his way to the demon world as well  \nafter coming face to face with arkham despite  donning the appearance of his father the   overwhelming power causes him to transform into  something much more reflective of the darkness  \ninside his heart while dante initially faces him  alone partway through the battle vergil joins the  \nfray seeking the power that was stolen from him  together the two brothers team up and take down  \nthe horrific creature they even get to once again  use their childhood catchphrase together jackpot\narkham is cast back to the human world where he  lands in front of his daughter this time around  \nhe doesn't hold back in expressing his desires  for becoming a god while he still attempts to   manipulate lady and asks that she help him she  refuses and kills the monster she's wanted to  \nfor so long despite what everything would indicate  lady was heavily distraught by this moment while  \nshe often spoke about how she only had one parent  in the form of her mother context clues would   say otherwise it seems that there was a point in  history where she loved her father and vice versa  \nhowever after he murdered his wife lady tried to  drown out her emotions with anger the end result  \nwas still her crying over the loss of her family  with arkham out of the picture it left sparta's  \nsword up for the taking vergil clearly seeks its  power and dante looks to keep it out of his hands  \nas they've done countless times before to settle  the matter the two fight unfortunately for  \nvergil this time he is bested at the hands of his  brother he is wounded so heavily that he is forced  \nto leave sparta's sword behind instead choosing  to keep his half of their mother's amulet  \nleaving the true power within the sword yet  again dormant with the portal connecting both  \nworlds closing vergil chooses to descend into the  demon world as it is where their father came from  \nand he seeks to be just like him  despite dante's attempt to save him   vergil slashes his hand preventing him  so he won't get trapped there as well  \ndante is forced to return to the human world  also distraught and saddened over the events   that transpired which comes much to the shock  of even lady are you crying it's only the rain  \nthe rain already stopped\nthe devils never cry i see\nmaybe somewhere out there even a devil may  cry when he loses a loved one don't you think  \nmaybe with everything seeming to  have been settled the two joined  \nforces dante was finally able to open and  find a name for his shop the devil may cry  \nand the two would continue their  profession of demon hunting\nvergil's fate would unfortunately not be so  uplifting having returned to the demon world  \nhe encounters mundus himself harboring a grudge  against what he did and blinded by the idea of  \npower flowing through his veins he rushes into  battle against him figuring that if sparta could  \ndefeat him so could he unfortunately he failed he  was too weakened from his battle with dante that  \neven posing a threat to mundus was impossible  vergil was defeated and his sword the yamato  \nwas shattered in the battle as punishment mundus  strung up his bloody and beaten body torturing him  \nmocking him for being a half-breed while vowing  to remove his human heart will and ego vergil  \nover the span of ten years would get corrupted and  tortured it was a living nightmare he was forced  \nto experience it was not an easy task on the part  of mundus i mind you vergil refused to give in and  \nrested control of his own will for a long time it  wasn't until mundus returned his mother's amulet  \nto him which he stole that it made him into one  of his puppets the sentimental part that existed  \nwithin him managed to drop his guard and thus  vergil was corrupted and was renamed nelo angelo  \nit was around this time dante would also make a  very important business partner named jd morrison  \nhe does have two separate character designs as it  was later changed but both would be the same man  \nhe's not actually a new character relatively  speaking as his story would go he was one of  \nthe many brokers who frequented bobby zeller  and worked with dante when he was tony redgrave  \nwhile enzo was the one dante mostly went to he did  take jobs from morrison from time to time as well  \nonce dante left changed his name and opened devil  may cry morrison later tracked him down learned  \nof his name change and became a business partner  the dynamic between morrison and enzo would switch  \nmorrison would then become dante's main  broker after he became accustomed to the   whole existence of demons while enzo  showed up with the occasional odd job\nas stated the events that span between devil may  cry 3 and 1 are 10 years dante goes from an 18  \nyear old amateur to a 29 year old professional  demon hunter sometime during that period he  \nand lady parted ways she went off to do her own  solo demon hunting but kept in touch every now  \nand then with jobs that she couldn't do herself  for the most part dante's life didn't change  \nthe person who was making moves in this time was  moondis enough time had passed since his last  \ndefeat against sparta he felt now was the right  time to try and invade the human world once more  \nwith the temen ni gru no longer operable he figured  he might have better chances opening a gate  \non malay island what makes this island so special  is that it is the closest physical location to the  \nunderworld in the human domain once established  as a citadel the occupants quickly experienced the  \nstrange happenings that the island possessed  time flowing differently in certain areas   crops growing out of season and terrifying  nightmares suffered by those who lived here  \nsince then the island has become a derelict of  time demonic influence has since warped and taken  \nhold of just about everything there to remain a  mystery the island's location changes every night  \nand appears in unexpected locations finding it can  be damn near impossible unless you already know  \nwhere it's going to be part of mundus's plan was  also killing sparta's remaining descendant dante  \nto save himself the hassle he wanted to lure him  to the island and to do so he created a demon to  \npsychologically manipulate him a demon was created  in perfect likeness of his and vergil's mother  \nlengthy blonde hair blue eyes and a fair  complexion she was a mirror image of their mother  \ntrish was her name she possessed the supernatural  powers of most demons like increased strength  \nspeed agility and so on but her most iconic power  would be her ability to control electricity it was  \nher job to lure in dante and so she set forth  towards his shop to hire him trish makes quite  \na bold first impression first showcasing knowledge  of who he is but more importantly his a vengeance  \nno one up until this point had ever really been  aware of dante's personal goal she reveals herself  \nto be a demon and gets into a small little scuffle  to make sure he really is the son of sparta dante  \nproves himself more than capable but just before  he goes to shoot her she actually reveals that she   needs his help as planned due to her resemblance  to his mother dante accepts her request\nshe guides him to malay island as thanks to mundus  she's aware of its location to be frank a lot  \nof dante's journey around the island is hardly  worthy of note only three of mundus's generals  \ninhabit it and attempt to stop him phantom a giant  molten arachnid griffin a large raptor-like bird  \nand most importantly nelo angelo vergil at  this point has no free will of his own and  \nacts according to mundus's commands he challenges  dante several times throughout his journey but he  \nwouldn't recognize that this was actually his  brother during their first bout nelo angelo  \ngets the upper hand but just when he's about  to finish him off dante's amulet slips into   his view which awakens the memories from his past  it causes him immense pain and he flees the scene  \ntheir second encounter resulted in dante simply  winning and nelo angelo forced to retreat  \nbut on their third and final encounter he  unleashed his full power for which dante gives   him a little respect but still not recognizing  him despite this dante yet again defeats nelo  \nangelo for the last time his corpse rises into  the air as he screams in pain and disappears  \nback to the demon world he drops his half of the  amulet which dante picks up and finally realizes  \nthat that was vergil all along with both halves  of the amulet restored and sparta's blade in hand  \nhis sword is restored to its true form seeing all  of his generals slain mundus has trish lure dante  \ninto a trap where he is forced to face a demon  referred to as nightmare it is a biological weapon  \nan amalgamation of varying demonic material with  the potential to consume all of the demon realm  \nit has the ability to pull you into an evil  dimension where you must face reflections   of trauma that rest in your subconscious dante is  successfully lured in and trish reveals herself to  \nbe on the side of mundus regardless the monster  is still defeated and in the aftermath of the  \nchaos the room begins to collapse seeing trish  about to get crushed dante rushes to her rescue  \nand saves her life it was an act that both  confused and moved her all the same not being  \nable to help but wonder why he would do something  like this he tells her about his mom and their   physical resemblance but being betrayed in this  manner hurt him in ways he'd never been used to  \nand lashes out at her with heated passion and love  towards his mother you may look like my mother  \nbut you know we're close to her you have no soul  you have the face but you'll never have her fire\ndespite dante's words trish was deeply moved by  his actions and actually won her over similarly  \ndante wasn't as hostile as he appeared part of him  still cared for her based on how she looked mundus  \nutilized this to his advantage and uses trish as  a hostage upon confronting mundus dante would yet  \nagain choose to value trish's life getting injured  as a result though in a surprise change of heart  \njust as mundus was about to deliver his  final blow trish pushes dante out of the way   taking the attack herself the sight of trish's  sacrifice only reminds him of the death of his  \nmother how powerless he was back then all of the  grief sorrow and anger all thanks to this one  \ndemon but this time around things are different  he's learned so much in his time as a demon hunter  \nhe's had to experience so many different hardships  all of his emotions are channeled into one immense  \npower that only could have come from the blood  of sparta mundus pulls him into a new dimension  \ngloating about how powerful he is and how he can  do anything like making as many mothers for dante  \nas he wanted similarly to how he made trish but  with a powerful belt of silence dante transforms  \ninto the form of sparta the grand battle commences  both from sky and on the ground with dante of  \ncourse emerging victorious even in victory the  feeling is bittersweet the loss of trish makes him  \nfeel guilty for not trying to fill her dark soul  with light in memoriam he leaves her both with his  \nmother's amulet as well as his father's sword but  as dante goes to leave the island he is yet again  \ninterrupted by mundus who was not killed and has  since shed his idealistic and angelic figure for  \nthe grotesque demon he always was no longer in the  demon world dante's powers are much more limited  \nthough in a surprise revival trish shows up  lending dante her power where the two are able  \nto push mundus away and seal him once more trish's  return isn't greatly expanded upon it's uncertain  \nif she was only gravely injured by mundus's  initial blast or if she was killed and brought  \nback to life many believe that she was killed but  thanks to the amulet and sword that dante gave her  \nit managed to resuscitate her anyway the reunion  of the two is chalk filled with emotion so much  \nso that trish even cries a sign to dante that a  devil has gained parts of humanity these tears  \ntears are a gift only humans have and  with that the two escape on a plane as  \nthe entire island collapses in on itself and  explodes in the aftermath of the event trish  \nthen begins working at dante's business  which he newly renamed devil never cry\ntrish and dante would work together for a few  years both getting accustomed to each other's   day-to-day habits or more accurately getting fed  up with them largely on the side of trish with  \ndante's excessive consumption of pizza for every  meal but regardless of their dynamic the two would  \ndevelop a very meaningful relationship with one  another not one of romance but as described by   the creator of the franchise something much more  we aren't spent much time with them witnessing the  \njobs that they took on but probably the most  important job the two took on in their time   as partners was from dante's old broker enzo  you see despite working with him for so long  \nenzo had never come to bear witness or  even believe in demons in the first place   he and trish became acquainted with each other  in their time same goes for morrison as well  \nand so he came to them for a job to explore  some ancient ruins that were under construction  \nbeing a bit of a weasel that he is he was  looking to find some treasures amongst the rubble   and he needed capable lookouts as it would turn  out he did find what he was looking for dante  \nand trish were attacked by demons and enzo found  a devil arm he initially manages to convince the  \ntwo to keep it but upon further research by trish  she uncovers it was a gun created by machiavelli  \none of the underworld's greatest gunsmiths he  had created many notable weapons the artemis  \nthe pandora and even the angelo's armor when they  learnt this they immediately sought out enzo only  \nto find him trying to sell the gun the demonic  force within the firearm then possessed enzo's  \nhand seeking to take over its host and claim its  freedom to save his life dante severed his arm  \nand destroyed the gun enzo would survive and it  came to really open his eyes and he came to fully  \nbelieve in the existence of demons the whole thing  gave him a change of heart he wanted to contribute  \nand help out in his own way and so he opened a  devil arms pawn shop where he would house all of  \nthe various weapons dante had collected throughout  his journey and brought to him this also made  \ntrish realize how she could help out elsewhere as  well considering her vast knowledge of the demon  \nworld and the weapons crafted there she thought  she could help prevent instances like what enzo   went through on her own and so she decided to  leave devil never cry to pursue her own path  \nshe also asked dante to revert his business  name back to devil may cry which he did  \nand with that after a few years of partnership  dante was back to his own solo gigs and we reached  \nthe events of devil may cry the animated series  this 12 episode anime gives us more of an insight  \ninto dante's day-to-day jobs the lesser demons  he's hired to take care of to keep his bills paid  \nas such morrison would get some on-screen time  and we get to witness first hand what he does for  \ndante as his broker a lot of the series actually  isn't too important to the larger overall timeline  \nhe does things like stop a demon who  kills via racing competing in a life or   death game of poker and even connecting two  lovebirds in a romeo and juliet situation  \nif romeo was a demon episodes like that expand  on the concept of demons even further and their  \nability to feel human emotions like his father  and trish did there are a few episodes that span  \nthe series that are definitely worthy of note  in episode 8 once upon a time dante is tracked  \ndown by his old childhood friend ernest and  brought back to morris island ever since the  \nday he was run out of town ernest was adamant  in proving dante's innocence and that a demon  \nwas responsible for the attack his method of doing  so was by summoning the demon and killing it with  \na shotgun by this point it should be obvious that  that plan wasn't going to work in the slightest  \nbecause of his idiocy dante is forced to fight the  demon the aftermath of everything wouldn't be very  \npleasant ernest learns that the reason the demon  came to the town in the first place was because  \nof dante he blames him for everything the death of  the people the deception of him and the others he  \nwas close to not a single shred of sympathy  is thrown towards him and he never wants to  \nsee him again dante of course leaves feeling  sorrowful about the situation as they were  \nonce friends but while dante's past friendships  may have become lost new ones are formed perhaps  \nnot with him specifically but his friends become  friends by that i'm referring to lady and trish  \nin the episode rolling thunder we get to witness  the very first time the two meet and it's not  \nexactly a friendly first impression you see trish  had been working an area that had become infested  \nwith demons ever since a new priest arrived she'd  been going around killing all of the lesser ones   which certainly put him on the back foot he didn't  want to risk getting killed himself so he actually  \ngot a bit creative by pretending to be an innocent  and humble priest whose town was under attack by  \na ruthless demon he hired lady to kill trish it  was a ruse she outright fell for because trish is  \na demon at the end of the day the two would clash  on multiple occasions going all out with extreme  \nvigor and animosity largely on the side of lady  they even have a bit of a spat at a clothing store  \nbut don't fight because there are in fact innocent  people around but in truth the whole situation was  \nmade complicated thanks to trish the demons she  was hunting were fairly weak and she hadn't been  \ntested by a worthy opponent in quite a while upon  seeing lady she seemed like the type who could  \nreally give her a run for her money and so decided  to keep fighting her dante was generous enough to  \nkeep it a secret for a little while until it  seemed like things might go too far everything  \ngets revealed at the church putting lady in a not  so great mood for having been played the entire  \ntime they confront the priest and he has the oh so  unfortunate fate of facing the wrath of all trish  \nlady and dante together the episode ends with the  two hitting it off they've come to form a mutual  \nrespect for each other in their fighting ability  fashion sense and pleasure in messing with dante  \nbut in terms of the larger plot that comes in the  form of a nine-year-old orphan girl named patty  \nlowell in the first episode of the series dante  is hired to protect her as she was supposedly  \nthe heiress of a large family fortune she didn't  know that she had the reason she needs protecting  \nis because there are apparently demons who will  kill for just money dante protects paddy against  \nall of those attacking but by the end of the  episode we learn that she was just used as a decoy   another woman by the name of patty lowell found  a girl who had the exact same name and so pinned  \nall of the media and attention onto her so  she could safely arrive undisturbed dante  \nkills the demon seeking the money and feeling  remorseful for putting a young child in danger  \nthe older paddy offers to raise her paddy would  decline this offer instead choosing to stay with  \ndante at his office the older paddy does still  try to make amends by giving the young girl a  \nhealthy sum of the fortune which she used to spend  on clothes and donating the rest to the orphanage  \nshe grew up in throughout the series paddy would  be a constant character always providing color  \ncommentary against dante however the truth is she  would have a lot more relevance than initially  \nmet the eye she was actually a descendant of a  powerful alchemist and sorcerer named alan lowell  \nallen used to have the ability to summon demons  and bend them to his will they were obedient and  \ndid whatever he commanded but one demon was much  too powerful and could not be controlled he was  \nknown as abigail and while not quite as strong  as a demon king he had power that could rival it  \nseeing how dangerous the power was allen created  a nigh impenetrable barrier and sealed it away  \na pendant known as allen's tear was left behind  and was the key to gaining abigail's sealed power  \nas such it was highly sought after by many demons  fortunately the pendant had the power to ward off  \nmany lesser demons protecting its wearer the  amulet was passed down through the generations  \nand eventually made its way to paddy's biological  mother nina lowell she feared for her daughter's  \nsafety and so chose to put her up for adoption  when she was still a baby so she didn't have to   live in constant danger the villain throughout  the series is a lesser demon named sid hoping  \nto claim the powers of abigail for himself a lot  of the events in the anime and jobs dante goes  \non are manipulated by sid as to break abigail's  seal he needs a variety of items for a ritual  \nso things like dante going back to morris island  killing two apprentices of sparta and so on are  \nall part of his plan the specifics about what the  ritual needs and why specific items are needed  \naren't exactly specified so it comes off as a  bunch of random things when he begins nearing  \nall of the items required he eventually makes his  play at stealing alan's tear from nina lowell he  \nkills and possesses her close friend simon and  convinces her to hand the amulet over to dante for  \nsafe keeping the only reason i can imagine he did  this was because he needed another powerful demon  \ndead to use for the ritual he does make an attempt  at pickpocketing the amulet however is stopped due  \nto its ward not feeling comfortable not being  in possession of it nina intends on taking the  \namulet back but before she can sid kidnaps her  as the amulet is now the last item he needs  \nconsidering that her mother has appeared out  of nowhere and patty being confident that it's   her becomes a key player as well as seeking the  truth about who this woman is knowing that she was  \nsupposed to come by and reclaim her amulet paddy  instead takes it herself hoping to deliver it to  \nher so she can see her when she arrives what she  is greeted with is sid holding her mother hostage  \nin exchange for not killing her paddy trades  alan's tear and sid uses it to break the seal

manage  \nto reach him he is awoken from his stupor and  lays waste to the demons running rampant nearby  \nbut the real problem is sid like many demons who  manage to attain such immense power he is given  \na false sense of unstoppable force it makes it  all the more intimidating to them when dante  \nsimply walks right through it he proclaims as he  has and would many times that the reason he

balls\ndante's next big adventure would come in the form  of a book in the devil may cry 2 light novel we  \nare introduced to a new character named beryl a  woman with red curly hair black bodysuit and armed  \nwith a heavy duty anti-tank rifle as with most new  additions her story introduces a whole plethora  \nof new lore her story goes when she was a young  girl her father tried to harness a demonic item  \nknown as the beast heads it was a demon created by  mundus which can take the form of either a statue  \nor an actual demon it can show that who touches  it the past present and future along with a lot of  \nother quirks while it bears a striking resemblance  to cerberus which dante has fought in the past  \nit's not actually related beryl's father tried to  use this item in hopes to bring his wife back from  \nthe dead however the power is much too dangerous  for the likes of humans as they're often driven  \ninsane upon contact it instead transformed him  into a demon as such he tried flying away with his  \ndaughter but was shot down in the process he also  stabbed her with the statue around her collar and  \nneck her wound eventually healed but she gained  the ability to sense the presence of the beast  \nheads when close her scar begins burning like  a game of hot and cold since then she's become  \na devil hunter seeking to one day put an end to  the beast heads the novel consists of her hiring  \ndante for his help and the two tracking it down  a lot of the story isn't too worthy of note the  \njourney is made especially difficult thanks to  an underworld crime syndicate run by a man named   chen who was interested in using the item when the  two actually encounter and fight the beast heads  \nit sucks them both into an alternate reality where  things get a bit silly and vary from history in  \nthis new dimension exists a world where mundus  had captured dante when he was still a child  \nvergil on the other hand still as the existence  of nelo angelo led a resistance against him with  \nhis lieutenants griffin and phantom without any of  his original allies mundus instead had an army of  \ntrishes at his command in this new reality dante  agrees to help fight against mundus once more  \nwhich he succeeds in and the two escape the  alternate reality the book ends with chen  \nabsorbing the beast heads for more power so  he can fight against dante but as per usual  \nthe devil hunter emerges victorious with barrel  putting one right between his eyes the beast heads  \nare destroyed and as thanks for helping her beryl  gives dante her weapon after this job it's unknown  \nwhat became of her months would pass and dante  presumes she just returned to a civilian life  \nsince her father was avenged and she no longer had  her gun but no one really knows for sure she is  \nhinted at much further down the timeline however  the woman shown bears almost no resemblance to  \nthe barrel depicted in the novel the book ends  months later when dante pondering about these  \nevents and his lack of jobs recently all of a  sudden gets a dagger thrown through his window  \nbearing an invitation to a museum and this leads  to the beginning of devil may cry 2. dante in both  \nthe novel and the second game would now be 33. the  plot of devil may cry 2 revolves around arga sax  \nif you recall he was the demon who challenged  mundus for control of the demon world long ago  \nand wound up splitting its loyalties into two  sparta defeated both of them sealing them away  \nfor argus acts he used four sacred relics referred  to as the arcana if united under the solar eclipse  \na gate to the demon world will open and argusax  freed considering that took place centuries ago  \na group who was there to witness and even summon  sparta for his assistance against him was formed  \nto safeguard the island of v de marley this group  were known as the protectors in modern day an evil  \nbusinessman named aryas is seeking to become an  all-powerful immortal like arkham he too has an  \nobsession with the dark arts and has become a  modern day sorcerer he managed to get away with   it thanks to being hidden in plain sight he runs a  multi-million dollar corporation known as oroborus  \nknown for its mining and construction in  reality he used his business to buy up land  \nwhich housed ancient ruins and pillaged whatever  he could relating to demons and the underworld  \nhe even used his knowledge of arcane sciences  to create artificial demons which he refers to  \nas secretaries one secretary labelled kai was a  defect but before she could be disposed of one  \nof the protectors of veda marley matiere found her  and raised her as a daughter kai would be renamed  \nlucia and be raised to become a protector herself  unaware of what she truly was when aryas began  \ntargeting the island it became clear that the  protectors needed additional assistance from   elsewhere while dante may have started out a  bit undercover when he started all of these  \njobs he's accomplished have made him into a bit of  a legendary devil hunter so his identity amongst  \nthose who need to know is fairly well known now  because of this lucia was the one who gave him the  \ninvitation to come to the museum to put it nicely  nearly all of the events that happen in the game  \naren't too relevant or worthy of note dante meets  mattie and accepts her job throughout the game he  \nfights against demons lucille learns that she's  an artificial demon and has an existential crisis  \nand the four arcanas are collected to summon  argosax aryus absorbs some power which mutates  \nhim however he's killed by lucia dante travels  to the demon world and puts an end to argosax  \ndespite the claim that he would be trapped  in the demon world if he went there as would   later be described by dante a portal opened up  randomly cause that's prone to happening and he  \njust walked through allowing him to return to  the human world lucia would come to terms with   what she is and the story ends with her and dante  reuniting unlike the others dante's had a history  \nwith lucia simply returns back to vida marley  to continue being a protector alongside matier","extra":{"bias":null,"memory":""}}
