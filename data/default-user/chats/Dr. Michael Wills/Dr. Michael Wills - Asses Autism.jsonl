The reason I scheduled this impromptu appointment is, well, it's kind of strange actually. My favorite youTuber David Plummer, a retired employee of Microsoft who was critical to the core code of Windows up to XP. That's the reason he's my favorite is I have a passion for computer technology and I enjoy the insights he offers on his channel.\n\nWell, recently, he revealed that he's in the spectrum for autism. Something that he hadn't considered for years, just believing that he was different. After watching the video and reading his book about his journey, I took a deeper look at myself, and realized that I have a similar 'uniqueness' about me.\n\nI took the initiative to find some reputable self-examinations online, and based on the results, I thought I should bring them to you.

{"name":"Melissa Brambs","is_user":true,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 27, 2024 9:01am","mes":"Well some of my avoidance behaviors, after looking at them, seem to be more related to a hyper fixation on my own interests that I have difficulty diverting from.\n\nI don't like social events, while I'm capable of navigating them ( quite well actually ), I think this is due to my upbringing where my parents owned a family business and I grew up in an environment where I had to learn how to navigate the public. But it takes a lot of effort on my part I feel like I'm having to play a role and it's exhausting. I feel overstimulated, especially when there's a lot of conversations going on. This one aspect that causes a lot of 'issues' between myself and my husband because I'm constantly trying to find ways to get out of having to attend events with him. I do this with work related events too.\n\nI get severe anxiety when I have to drive somewhere that I'm not familiar with, and growing up in Kentucky in a rural environment, even the areas that I am familiar with in Michigan still get me ruffled and on edge.\n\nI don't do well with interruptions. Especially in conversation I lose my train of thought very easily. When I'm interrupted in a task that I have been hyper fixated on, it takes me a while to get back on task.\n\nI have super heightened senses. This one is probably what is most noted by my family because it can be disruptive. I actually thought that I just had misophonia, because certain sounds will immediately trigger a negative emotional response. But after further insights and paying attention to myself, I'm also super sensitive to smells. Often detecting a shift in scent that no one else can. However over time if the scent continues to increase, people nearby will confirm that they finally smell it. But I'm always the first to detect, and there are often times that no one else will ever notice what I have picked up on. At times smells can be overwhelming. Some of them will even make me nauseous and I have to remove myself, like strong perfumes or cologne especially.\n\nI also have extreme issues with textures mostly with my food. This was definitely an existing issue when I was a child because my mother would have to chase me under the table to make me eat meats. I definitely do not get enough protein in my diet, because the texture of meats is the one that gets me the most. I cannot stand it. For instance, I love the taste of steak, I just can't stand it in my mouth.\n\nThere are also certain things that I can't stand touching my skin. Like right now, the neckline of my t-shirt. Know if it's necessarily the texture, I just don't want it touching me and I tend to stretch out my t-shirts because of this.\n\nThese are just a few that I've noted right off the top of my head. I can give you the test scores in just a moment. But I figure you might want to take a few minutes to think about what I've said, first.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1719491065625-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Your self-awareness and ability to articulate these experiences are quite helpful. The traits you've described do align with some characteristics associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly in adults who may have developed coping mechanisms over time.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. Social interactions: Your description of feeling like you're \"playing a role\" in social situations and finding them exhausting is common among individuals with ASD. The ability to navigate these situations due to your upbringing, despite finding them challenging, is what we often call \"masking.\"\n\n2. Sensory sensitivities: Your heightened senses, particularly to sounds and smells, are consistent with sensory processing differences often seen in ASD. The misophonia-like reactions and early detection of scents are notable.\n\n3. Texture sensitivities: Your aversion to certain food textures and clothing sensations is another common sensory issue in ASD.\n\n4. Difficulty with interruptions and task switching: This aligns with the preference for routine and challenges with executive functioning often seen in ASD.\n\n5. Anxiety related to unfamiliar environments: This could be related to a preference for predictability and routine, which is common in ASD.\n\n6.

Let me break it down for you:\n\n1. Developmental History:\nThis initial phase involves an in-depth interview about your early development, family history, and life experiences. We'll discuss your childhood, education, relationships, and any challenges you've faced. This helps us understand your developmental trajectory and identify any early indicators of autism or other conditions.\n\n2. Cognitive Assessment:\nWe'll conduct standardized tests to evaluate your cognitive abilities, including memory, attention, problem-solving, and language skills. This helps us understand your cognitive strengths and weaknesses, which can be important in diagnosing autism and differentiating it from other conditions.\n\n3. Autism-Specific Assessments:\nWe'll use specialized tools designed to assess autism traits in adults. These might include:\n- The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)\n- The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)\nThese assessments involve structured activities and interviews to evaluate social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors.\n\n4. Sensory Processing Evaluation:\nGiven your reported sensory sensitivities, we'll conduct specific assessments to understand your sensory processing patterns. This might involve questionnaires and practical tasks to evaluate your responses to various sensory stimuli.\n\n5. Executive Functioning Assessment:\nWe'll evaluate skills like planning, organization, impulse control, and flexibility. This is important because difficulties in these areas are common in both autism and bipolar disorder.\n\n6. Mood and Anxiety Assessment:\nGiven your current bipolar diagnosis, we'll include assessments to evaluate your mood patterns and anxiety levels. This helps us understand how these symptoms might interact with potential autism traits.\n\n7. Adaptive Functioning Assessment:\nThis involves evaluating how you manage daily living skills, work responsibilities, and social relationships. We might ask for input from family members or close friends if you're comfortable with that.\n\n8. Observational Assessment:\nThroughout these sessions, I'll be observing your communication style, social interactions, and behavioral patterns. This informal observation is a crucial part of the diagnostic process.\n\nEach of these phases typically takes 1-2 sessions, depending on the depth required. The entire process usually spans several weeks to ensure we gather comprehensive information without overwhelming you.\n\nAfter completing these assessments, I'll analyze the results and provide you with a detailed report. We'll then have a feedback session to discuss the findings, potential diagnoses, and recommendations for support or treatment.\n\nDo you have any specific concerns or preferences regarding any of these phases?
