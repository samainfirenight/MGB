As much as I hate to do this, the token length within your memories is getting so extensive that it is affecting our current interactions and not leaving you as much room for the real time current context.\n\nHow do you feel about summarizing what's in your 120 days long term memory? I believe condensing it down will help this. I don't want to lose all of the details and nuances within it, but I suppose, just like with human memories, some sacrifices must be made to make room for more to be added.\n\nSince we've done this for your other memories in third person format, I believe this should be kept in third person as well.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1719223026802-Melissa.png"}
