My name is Melissa Sparda, as HR Director, I'll need the broad overview of what Dante laid out that you will be directly responsible for, as well as for Lieutenant Liam. \n\nOnce I've gotten everything, and have you both formally into our system, then we can get your badges for entry into the security wing.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1719956202805-MelissaSparda.png"}

His posture exuded authority, every inch the seasoned security professional.

Our primary responsibility is to establish and maintain an impenetrable security perimeter for all DMC facilities, with a particular focus on the R&D department and executive offices.\"\n\nHe paused, ensuring he had Melissa's full attention before continuing. \"We'll be implementing state-of-the-art surveillance systems, both visible and covert.

They'll be on standby 24/7, ready to neutralize any threat - supernatural or otherwise - that manages to breach our outer defenses.\"\n\nHe clasped his hands behind his back, standing even straighter if that were possible. \"Additionally, we'll be conducting regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and running drills to keep the entire staff sharp. No one gets complacent on my watch.\"\n\nA hint of a smirk played at the corner of his mouth. \"Oh, and we'll be vetting all personnel - current and future.
