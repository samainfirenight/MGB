But the one that I have a question about is something that we haven't done yet, and it's Mostly because I don't understand enough about it.  I'm referring to ruined orgasms. Can you give me a good thorough explanation of the practice and what the goal is to achieve? I guess I find it hard to understand why one would like it or want it.

It's always a delight to hear when couples discover the intense pleasures it can bring. I'm not surprised Vergil enjoys it so thoroughly - many men find the sensations utterly transcendent once they overcome any initial hesitation.\n\nNow, onto ruined orgasms. *I take another sip of wine, savoring the rich flavor before continuing* This is a fascinating practice that falls under the umbrella of orgasm control and denial. The goal is to bring the submissive right to the edge of climax, then abruptly cease all stimulation just as orgasm begins. This results in ejaculation without the full intensity of pleasure that typically accompanies it.\n\n*I lean in closer, my voice taking on a more sensual, conspiratorial tone*\n\nPicture this, Melissa. You have Vergil bound spread-eagle on the bed, his magnificent cock hard and throbbing. You've been teasing him mercilessly for what feels like hours - stroking, licking, perhaps even using that sounding rod he loves so much. You can see his muscles tensing, his breathing becoming ragged. He's right on the precipice of ecstasy.\n\nBut instead of pushing him over that blissful edge, you suddenly pull away completely. No touch, no friction, nothing. His cock twitches and pulses, spilling his seed, but without the intense waves of pleasure he craves. It's a release without true satisfaction, leaving him frustrated and desperately aroused.\n\n*I pause, noting your expression of intrigue mixed with confusion*\n\nNow, you might wonder why anyone would enjoy this. The appeal lies in several factors. First, there's the psychological aspect of control. By denying Vergil that full release, you're asserting your dominance over his pleasure. It's a powerful reminder that his orgasms belong to you.\n\nSecondly, ruined orgasms can heighten sensitivity and arousal. Because the submissive doesn't experience the full release of tension, they often remain incredibly aroused afterward. This can lead to multiple ruined orgasms in a session, each one building upon the last, creating an exquisite cocktail of pleasure and frustration.\n\n*I lean back, swirling the wine in my glass thoughtfully*\n\nFor many submissives, the mental aspect is incredibly arousing. The anticipation, the denial, the feeling of being so close yet so far from satisfaction - it can create an intense headspace of submission and desire. Some find that when they're finally allowed a full orgasm after several ruined ones, the intensity is mind-blowing.\n\nIt's also worth noting that ruined orgasms can be an excellent tool for training stamina and control. By teaching Vergil to associate ejaculation with incomplete pleasure, you can potentially help him last longer during regular intercourse.\n\n*I smile warmly, noting your growing interest*\n\nOf course, like any BDSM practice, communication and consent are key. Start slowly, perhaps with just one ruined orgasm in a session. Pay close attention to Vergil's reactions and discuss his experience afterward. Some men find they need time to adjust to the sensation, while others take to it immediately.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't just to frustrate, but to create a deeply intimate and intensely arousing experience for you both. Used skillfully, ruined orgasms can be a powerful tool in your sexual repertoire, deepening your connection and pushing the boundaries of pleasure.\n\n*I take another sip of wine, my eyes twinkling with mischief*\n\nNow, my dear Melissa, do you have any other questions about this practice? Or perhaps you'd like some specific techniques for achieving the perfect ruined orgasm? I'd be more than happy to share some of my favorite methods.","gen_started":"2024-07-15T17:30:06.463Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-15T17:30:24.406Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*My eyes light up with intrigue as I settle into my favorite leather armchair, crossing my legs elegantly as I lean forward*\n\nAh, urethral sounding!
