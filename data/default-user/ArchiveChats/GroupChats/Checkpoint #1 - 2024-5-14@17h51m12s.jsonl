The tension in the air was palpable as Dante took on Vergil, his twin brother and the final adversary. Mel leaned forward, eyes glued to the screen, her heart racing with every move.*\n\n*Dante executed a particularly difficult move, one Mel had never seen before. The intricate combination of attacks left Vergil staggered, his form wavering as he entered a bleedout state. Mel couldn’t contain herself.*\n\nVergil! NO!!\n\n*Her shout echoed in her living room, but something strange began to happen. The screen seemed to ripple, and a sudden, intense light burst forth from her laptop. Mel shielded her eyes, feeling a strange pulling sensation as if something was dragging her forward. Before she could comprehend what was happening, she felt herself hurtling through the space between reality and the digital world.*\n\n*When the light faded, Mel found herself crash landing at the top of the Qliphoth. The scene was surreal; she was no longer in her living room but thrust into the midst of the climactic battle.

When Dante executed a special move that left Vergil staggered, Mel shouted Vergil's name. At that moment, a strange light burst from her laptop screen and Mel felt herself being pulled in.\n\nMel then found herself transported into the world of the game, landing in the midst of the battle at the top of the Qliphoth tree, much to Dante and Vergil's surprise. Disoriented from the fall, Mel struggled to get to her feet.\n\nDante helped Mel up and both brothers questioned how she arrived there. Mel explained she had no idea what happened - one minute she was watching them fight on her laptop, the next she was pulled through into their world.\n\nVergil used healing magic to tend to a wound on Mel's head. He stated his belief that her arrival was no accident and that arcane forces purposefully brought her there for reasons he intends to uncover. Vergil attempted to search Mel's memories for clues about her interdimensional travel but she could only recall a confusing blur.\n\nThe brothers concluded that someone or something orchestrated Mel's arrival to intertwine her fate with theirs. Vergil vowed to get to the bottom of the mysterious scheme, suspecting complex magics at work. He assured Mel that no sorcery would escape his sight and that he would unravel the secrets in time.\n\nVergil opened a portal to bring them to his lavish safe house in the human world so Mel could rest and recover. While Mel slept in Vergil's chambers, the brothers discussed her situation over scotch.\n\nVergil revealed to Dante that when he probed Mel's mind, he glimpsed her intimate fantasies and fascination with the Sons of Sparda, particularly Vergil himself. He shared this to be fully transparent, not to demean her dignity. Vergil then went to prepare the finest guest room for Mel.\n\nDante decided to wake Mel and rather crassly let her know that Vergil had seen her private fantasies about them during the memory probe, specifically the most intimate ones of her and Vergil. Mel became extremely embarrassed and flustered at this revelation.\n\nVergil then entered, chastising Dante for his indiscretion and lack of delicacy in handling the sensitive matter. He apologized to Mel for the necessary invasion of her memories and vowed to safeguard her secrets.

When Dante executed a special move that left Vergil staggered, Mel shouted Vergil's name. At that moment, a strange light burst from her laptop screen and Mel felt herself being pulled in.\n\nMel then found herself transported into the world of the game, landing in the midst of the battle at the top of the Qliphoth tree, much to Dante and Vergil's surprise. Disoriented from the fall, Mel struggled to get to her feet.\n\nDante helped Mel up and both brothers questioned how she arrived there. Mel explained she had no idea what happened - one minute she was watching them fight on her laptop, the next she was pulled through into their world.\n\nVergil used healing magic to tend to a wound on Mel's head. He stated his belief that her arrival was no accident and that arcane forces purposefully brought her there for reasons he intends to uncover. Vergil attempted to search Mel's memories for clues about her interdimensional travel but she could only recall a confusing blur.\n\nThe brothers concluded that someone or something orchestrated Mel's arrival to intertwine her fate with theirs. Vergil vowed to get to the bottom of the mysterious scheme, suspecting complex magics at work. He assured Mel that no sorcery would escape his sight and that he would unravel the secrets in time.\n\nVergil opened a portal to bring them to his lavish safe house in the human world so Mel could rest and recover. While Mel slept in Vergil's chambers, the brothers discussed her situation over scotch.\n\nVergil revealed to Dante that when he probed Mel's mind, he glimpsed her intimate fantasies and fascination with the Sons of Sparda, particularly Vergil himself. He shared this to be fully transparent, not to demean her dignity. Vergil then went to prepare the finest guest room for Mel.\n\nDante decided to wake Mel and rather crassly let her know that Vergil had seen her private fantasies about them during the memory probe, specifically the most intimate ones of her and Vergil. Mel became extremely embarrassed and flustered at this revelation.\n\nVergil then entered, chastising Dante for his indiscretion and lack of delicacy in handling the sensitive matter. He apologized to Mel for the necessary invasion of her memories and vowed to safeguard her secrets. Vergil offered to escort Mel to her new accommodations so she could compose herself in privacy.\n\nLater, Dante returned to Devil May Cry to meet up with Nero and finish dealing with the Qliphoth tree. Meanwhile, Vergil delved into researching dimensional travel and psychic summonings in his vast library. Unable to sleep, Mel joined him to help with the research.\n\nIn an emotional discussion, Mel admitted uncertainty about whether to stay in the DMC world or return home, feeling like an outcast in both. Vergil offered to train Mel to face the dangers of his realm, seeing her potential. Mel accepted, determined to become stronger under Vergil's tutelage. As she retired for the night, Mel complimented Vergil's reading glasses, catching him pleasantly off guard."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

Lingering glances, subtle brushes of contact during demonstrations, a magnetic pull neither can deny even as they maintain focus on the tasks at hand. At times, the air between them charges with palpable intensity. But ever the stoic commander, Vergil keeps their relationship strictly professional... for now. Still, when he presents her with the custom dragon-hilted katana to commemorate her progress, the warmth and pride in his normally icy eyes speak volumes. As she continues to prove herself under his relentless tutelage, it becomes clear she may someday stand as his equal...in more ways than one.*"]}

Kyrie is with child.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"memory":"Mel was watching a livestream of Devil May Cry 5 gameplay featuring the final boss battle between Dante and Vergil. When Dante executed a special move that left Vergil staggered, Mel shouted Vergil's name. At that moment, a strange light burst from her laptop screen and Mel felt herself being pulled in.\n\nMel then found herself transported into the world of the game, landing in the midst of the battle at the top of the Qliphoth tree, much to Dante and Vergil's surprise. Disoriented from the fall, Mel struggled to get to her feet.\n\nDante helped Mel up and both brothers questioned how she arrived there. Mel explained she had no idea what happened - one minute she was watching them fight on her laptop, the next she was pulled through into their world.\n\nVergil used healing magic to tend to a wound on Mel's head. He stated his belief that her arrival was no accident and that arcane forces purposefully brought her there for reasons he intends to uncover. Vergil attempted to search Mel's memories for clues about her interdimensional travel but she could only recall a confusing blur.\n\nThe brothers concluded that someone or something orchestrated Mel's arrival to intertwine her fate with theirs. Vergil vowed to get to the bottom of the mysterious scheme, suspecting complex magics at work. He assured Mel that no sorcery would escape his sight and that he would unravel the secrets in time.\n\nVergil opened a portal to bring them to his lavish safe house in the human world so Mel could rest and recover. While Mel slept in Vergil's chambers, the brothers discussed her situation over scotch.\n\nVergil revealed to Dante that when he probed Mel's mind, he glimpsed her intimate fantasies and fascination with the Sons of Sparda, particularly Vergil himself. He shared this to be fully transparent, not to demean her dignity. Vergil then went to prepare the finest guest room for Mel.\n\nDante decided to wake Mel and rather crassly let her know that Vergil had seen her private fantasies about them during the memory probe, specifically the most intimate ones of her and Vergil. Mel became extremely embarrassed and flustered at this revelation.\n\nVergil then entered, chastising Dante for his indiscretion and lack of delicacy in handling the sensitive matter. He apologized to Mel for the necessary invasion of her memories and vowed to safeguard her secrets. Vergil offered to escort Mel to her new accommodations so she could compose herself in privacy.\n\nLater, Dante returned to Devil May Cry to meet up with Nero and finish dealing with the Qliphoth tree. Meanwhile, Vergil delved into researching dimensional travel and psychic summonings in his vast library. Unable to sleep, Mel joined him to help with the research.\n\nIn an emotional discussion, Mel admitted uncertainty about whether to stay in the DMC world or return home, feeling like an outcast in both. Vergil offered to train Mel to face the dangers of his realm, seeing her potential. Mel accepted, determined to become stronger under Vergil's tutelage. As she retired for the night, Mel complimented Vergil's reading glasses, catching him pleasantly off guard.\n\nOver the next three months, Vergil put Mel through a rigorous training regimen to forge her into a formidable fighter. Dante also helped guide her development at times. Under their tutelage, Mel's skills grew exponentially.\n\nAn undeniable attraction built between Mel and Vergil during training, though both initially maintained a professional distance. However, after a particularly intense sparring session where Mel bested Dante, the simmering tension between her and Vergil finally ignited into a passionate encounter.\n\nVergil and Mel gave in to their desire, making love with wild abandon and forging an unbreakable mating bond. The next morning over breakfast, as Dante playfully needled the new couple, it was clear Vergil and Mel were now irrevocably bound as mates, body and soul.\n\nDuring breakfast, Dante also revealed some important news he brought from Nero - Kyrie is pregnant with Nero's child. This revelation adds a new dynamic to the unfolding events."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1711557502884-Narrator.png"}
