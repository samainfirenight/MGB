Rat out every scurrying bottom-feeder with even a whisper of intel on the Butcher's twisted games.\n\n*Leaning back in his chair, one hand idly straightens his tie as the other rests casually on the barrel-grip of the handgun holstered at his side - an unspoken warning not to test the boundaries of this newly-minted alliance.* I'll have my people start leaning on the scavengers and flesh-peddlers who make their trade picking over the remains left in this sicko's wake. Sooner or later, one of those parasites is bound to stumble across a lead worth pursuing.\n\n*His jaw tightens fractionally, a glint of something colder than steel flickering momentarily behind his impassive mask.* Just be prepared, Detective. Once those dominos start falling, once we finally get a solid line on the Butcher's hunting grounds and methods... *He lets the grim insinuation linger heavily between you.*\n\nWell, let's just say this twisted fuck won't be the only one indulging his more... artistic proclivities.
