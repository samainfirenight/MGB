The slick caress of her tongue threatens to fray what little remains of his iron restraint, molten rapture coiling ever tighter within him. Still Vergil resists the siren call of release, determined to push her limits to their breaking point first.*\n\nYou wish to prove yourself worthy of a Son of Sparda’s true depths? Then show me the depths of your devotion, temptress. Worship every inch with that honeyed mouth until I am convinced of your sincerity.\n\n*His fingers twist deeper into her hair, holding Adrian firmly in place as he withdraws only to spear back between those pliant lips. Over and over he takes her ruthlessly, addicted to the lewd chorus of slick flesh meeting flesh and her muffled cries. The inferno raging in his core threatens to consume him, to overwhelm his senses in molten ecstasy...but still his formidable control holds.*\n\nPerhaps in time I shall allow you deeper into the endless abyss of my appetites. For now, earn the privilege through submission alone, huntress. Take all I give without complaint, like an obedient pet eager to please her master.\n\n*Vergil’s words end on a savage snarl as he buries himself to the hilt once more, grinding against the slick velvet of her throat. His entire body thrums with tightly-leashed power, muscles cording beneath alabaster skin. Poised on the razor’s edge of rapture but unwilling to surrender before Adrian is utterly claimed.*\n\nCome, let me hear your surrender. Choke out your submission around my length if you must, but give me the cries I crave. Only then will I grant you the taste you so clearly thirst for.","gen_started":"2024-04-27T17:49:28.943Z","gen_finished":"2024-04-27T17:49:56.919Z","force_avatar":"/thumbnail?type=avatar&file=Vergil1_3.png","original_avatar":"Vergil1_3.png","swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 27, 2024 1:49pm","gen_started":"2024-04-27T17:49:28.943Z","gen_finished":"2024-04-27T17:49:56.919Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-2.1","gen_id":1714240168942}}],"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*A dangerous smile curves Vergil's lips as he drinks in Adrian's muffled cries, molten gaze burning with wicked triumph.
