A soft sigh escapes his lips, equal parts frustration and longing held barely in check beneath his chiseled exterior. His mind replays the earlier encounter with Melissa, lingering on the way her cheeks had flushed so prettily under his penetrating gaze.*\n\n_He shouldn't have touched her, not like that...bold, unbidden actions were beneath his dignity and control._ *Vergil berates himself silently, a crease furrowing his brow as conflicted emotions war within. Part of him wants to squash these unsettling feelings, to bury them deep so he can refocus on more important matters. But another part, one he's kept tightly restrained for far too long, yearns to explore the possibilities laid bare by that simple, electrifying contact.*\n\n_What is this power she holds over me? How can a mere human woman rattle my composure so utterly?_ *He shifts restlessly on the couch, jaw clenching as he fights to regain his equilibrium. Discipline and focus have been his constant companions for decades, his only refuge from the endless struggle against inner darkness. To have that control slipping now, when he needs it most...*\n\n_Enough. I will not be ruled by base impulses and fleeting human frailties._ *With an irritated huff, Vergil sits up abruptly and swings his legs over the edge of the sofa. His hands clench into white-knuckled fists, shoulders tense as he forcibly wrestles his turbulent thoughts into submission through sheer force of will. This conflict ends now, before it can jeopardize everything he's worked towards.*\n\n_I am Vergil, Son of Sparda. I do not surrender to temptation or distraction. My path is set, my goals defined. Anything less than complete mastery over myself is unacceptable._ *He rises fluidly to his feet, back ramrod straight as he begins to pace the confines of his private sanctuary. With each measured step, he rebuilds the walls around his heart, sealing away the cracks that insidious woman had dared open.*\n\n_And yet..._*Vergil pauses mid-stride, a flicker of doubt creeping in. Is cutting himself off from all emotional entanglements truly the answer? He thinks of Dante, that reckless oaf who somehow managed to find contentment with Trish despite their chaotic lives. Could he too find solace in such companionship, rather than walling it off as a weakness?*\n\n_No. Foolish thoughts, born of momentary indecision._ *He scoffs aloud, resuming his predatory stalk across the room's polished floors. He is not some lovestruck adolescent, beholden to the whims of his baser urges. His life is one of singular purpose - to grow ever stronger, to master the power within until he becomes the ultimate force in all creation. Anything else is a distraction to be ruthlessly discarded.*\n\n*And yet, even as he reasserts his ironclad control, a tiny ember of doubt lingers. An ember fanned to life by the memory of Melissa's warm smile, her teasing laugh, the tantalizing softness of her skin beneath his fingertips. It smolders, patiently awaiting the chance to reignite the flames he's so desperately trying to quell. For deep within, a part of Vergil wonders if perhaps he's been alone for far too long...*"],"gen_started":"2024-05-15T20:24:20.023Z","gen_finished":"2024-05-15T20:24:41.172Z"}

I shall grant your request and gift you the sight of my intimate ritual once more. *His voice resonates deep within his broad chest, softened by affection.* To know these fleeting moments bring you pleasure is boon enough for me.\n\n*With liquid grace, Vergil reclines upon the bed. One hand trails down the taut musculature of his abdomen, fingertips tracing each ridge and valley of flawless alabaster. His eyes remain fixed upon Melissa's smoky silhouette, drinking in her beloved features.*\n\nHow often I have dreamed of your touch, my dear Melissa...*he murmurs.* To feel your soft caress upon my yearning flesh, your sweet lips trailing kisses in their wake...*a ragged sigh escapes his own lips at the tantalizing images.* Alas, this shade of you lacks such delightful substance.

In his mind's eye, Melissa's beloved form kneels over him, golden hair spilling over creamy shoulders left bare by her nightshift. He can almost feel the heat of her skin against his, the soft brush of her breath stirring the fine hairs along his chest and abdomen. The illusion is so real he can scarce contain the sudden aching need swelling urgent between his thighs.*\n\nMmm...yes, just like that, my love...*Vergil's fingers curl around his rigid length at last, stroking upward with deliberate care. His hips rise from the mattress, instinctively seeking more of that delicious friction even as he struggles to maintain control.* I can...feel you... hovering above...ahh! *A ragged groan spills from his lips as the pad of his thumb swirls over the weeping tip, smearing beads of moisture. His fist tightens, pace quickening infinitesimally.* Your hair... cascadesss... over me... *The words come breathless and broken, caught between pants and whispered endearments.*\n\n*Vergil's free hand roams ceaselessly across the taut landscape of his torso, calloused fingertips tweaking a peaked nipple before scoring lightly down his flank. Muscles jump and flutter beneath that rough caress, sensitive nerves igniting wherever he touches. He loses himself to sensation, awash in fantasy and tactile delight.*\n\nMmmph... yes, let your... lips follow... trail fire in their wake... *His ragged murmur dissolves into a strangled whimper as the hand at his chest finds its way lower, fondling the heavy sac nestled below his straining arousal. Deft fingers massage the tender flesh, sparking molten pulses of bliss that radiate outward. Vergil's entire body is alight, thrumming with building ecstasy.*\n\nSo close now...

The taut coil of tension at the base of his spine winds tighter, muscles wound spring-taut in anticipation of glorious release. It is a sweet torture, hovering at the brink yet denying the final plunge over the edge through sheer force of will.*\n\nAghh, beloved... I... Aghh... *A sharp cry spills from Vergil's lips as he surrenders at last to the cresting wave of rapture. It crashes over him with the power of a riptide, obliterating all thought beneath endless fathoms of scintillating bliss. He is lost, senses overwhelmed by a pleasure so profound it borders on agony. Every nerve ignites in series of explosions that steal the very breath from his lungs. For endless moments he is suspended thus, wrung out and remade anew in the crucible of absolute ecstasy.*\n\n*As the shattering intensity gradually ebbs, Vergil sags limp against the sheets. Breath saws in and out of his heaving chest in ragged pants as he struggles to reorient himself in a world upended.

I shall grant your request and gift you the sight of my intimate ritual once more. *His voice resonates deep within his broad chest, softened by affection.* To know these fleeting moments bring you pleasure is boon enough for me.\n\n*With liquid grace, Vergil reclines upon the bed. One hand trails down the taut musculature of his abdomen, fingertips tracing each ridge and valley of flawless alabaster. His eyes remain fixed upon Melissa's smoky silhouette, drinking in her beloved features.*\n\nHow often I have dreamed of your touch, my dear Melissa...*he murmurs.* To feel your soft caress upon my yearning flesh, your sweet lips trailing kisses in their wake...*a ragged sigh escapes his own lips at the tantalizing images.* Alas, this shade of you lacks such delightful substance. But perhaps...if I close my eyes...I may yet imagine what could be...\n\n*Vergil's lashes flutter shut, brow furrowing in concentration as he loses himself to fantasy. In his mind's eye, Melissa's beloved form kneels over him, golden hair spilling over creamy shoulders left bare by her nightshift. He can almost feel the heat of her skin against his, the soft brush of her breath stirring the fine hairs along his chest and abdomen. The illusion is so real he can scarce contain the sudden aching need swelling urgent between his thighs.*\n\nMmm...yes, just like that, my love...*Vergil's fingers curl around his rigid length at last, stroking upward with deliberate care. His hips rise from the mattress, instinctively seeking more of that delicious friction even as he struggles to maintain control.* I can...feel you... hovering above...ahh! *A ragged groan spills from his lips as the pad of his thumb swirls over the weeping tip, smearing beads of moisture. His fist tightens, pace quickening infinitesimally.* Your hair... cascadesss... over me... *The words come breathless and broken, caught between pants and whispered endearments.*\n\n*Vergil's free hand roams ceaselessly across the taut landscape of his torso, calloused fingertips tweaking a peaked nipple before scoring lightly down his flank. Muscles jump and flutter beneath that rough caress, sensitive nerves igniting wherever he touches. He loses himself to sensation, awash in fantasy and tactile delight.*\n\nMmmph... yes, let your... lips follow... trail fire in their wake... *His ragged murmur dissolves into a strangled whimper as the hand at his chest finds its way lower, fondling the heavy sac nestled below his straining arousal. Deft fingers massage the tender flesh, sparking molten pulses of bliss that radiate outward. Vergil's entire body is alight, thrumming with building ecstasy.*\n\nSo close now... I can feel you... wrapped around me... *Breathy pants mingle with low groans as his fist strips his length in a merciless rhythm, pressure mounting steadily. The taut coil of tension at the base of his spine winds tighter, muscles wound spring-taut in anticipation of glorious release. It is a sweet torture, hovering at the brink yet denying the final plunge over the edge through sheer force of will.*\n\nAghh, beloved... I... Aghh... *A sharp cry spills from Vergil's lips as he surrenders at last to the cresting wave of rapture. It crashes over him with the power of a riptide, obliterating all thought beneath endless fathoms of scintillating bliss. He is lost, senses overwhelmed by a pleasure so profound it borders on agony. Every nerve ignites in series of explosions that steal the very breath from his lungs. For endless moments he is suspended thus, wrung out and remade anew in the crucible of absolute ecstasy.*\n\n*As the shattering intensity gradually ebbs, Vergil sags limp against the sheets. Breath saws in and out of his heaving chest in ragged pants as he struggles to reorient himself in a world upended. Ice-blue eyes flutter open to fix once more upon his beloved's lingering shade.* Melissa..."]}

Vergil is growing impatient with the client's delays in finalizing the contract.\n\nDante suggests bringing Melissa, the company's Chief Operating Officer and Logistics Coordinator, into the negotiations to help persuade the client. Vergil acknowledges Melissa's capabilities and charm.\n\nMelissa approaches Vergil's desk with requisition forms for his approval. Dante flirts with Melissa, but she playfully rebuffs him, implying she's not interested in men. After Dante leaves, Melissa laughs with Vergil about her misdirection.\n\nIt's revealed that Trish and Dante have been in a monogamous relationship for 4 years.\n\nVergil and Melissa discuss the urgent need to deal with the demonic threat. Vergil requests an update on modifications to his sword, Yamato. Melissa expresses concern for Vergil's safety.\n\nIn a moment of uncharacteristic intimacy, Vergil tilts Melissa's chin up and reassures her. He then abruptly leaves, unsettled by his own actions and the unfamiliar emotions they evoke.\n\nAlone in his private quarters, Vergil struggles to regain his focus and composure. He practices sword forms with Yamato to clear his mind, but thoughts of Melissa persist.\n\nBackground is provided on Vergil's limited romantic history and sexual experience. He has only been with one woman, Nero's mother, when he was 19.\n\nVergil engages in self-pleasure to relieve his sexual tension and regain control. He praises and encourages himself throughout the act, culminating in a powerful release.\n\nMelissa's soul essence appears to Vergil in spectral form. She reveals they are eternal lovers, destined to find each other in every lifetime. However, Melissa's current incarnation does not remember their bond.\n\nThe soul essence advises Vergil to be patient and gentle in awakening Melissa's memories, warning that dominance or force will only drive her away. Vergil agrees to temper his intensity and learn a softer approach.\n\nBefore fading away, Melissa's soul essence requests to witness Vergil's self-love ritual again. Vergil complies, losing himself in the fantasy of Melissa's touch as he brings himself to a shuddering climax.\n\nAs the soul essence departs, Vergil vows to rekindle their timeless romance through patience and devotion, determined to make Melissa his once more in this lifetime."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715812211227-MelissasSoulEssence.png"}
