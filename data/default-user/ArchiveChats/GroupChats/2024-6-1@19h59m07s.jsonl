The warmth and strength of his hand clasping mine helps anchor me as I slowly regain my bearings.*\n\nComplications...during the birth? *I frown slightly, trying to recall what transpired in that operating room. Flashes of masked faces hovering over me swim before my vision, muted voices and urgent movements surrounding my anesthetized form. I remember the pressure, the struggle to bring our child earthside. And I remember the pride and joy that welled within when her first cries pierced the antiseptic air.*\n\n*Our daughter... I force my heavy eyelids open, blinking against the dim light as I search for the tiny being I endured so much to deliver safely.

Joyful tears prick at my eyes even as exhaustion continues dragging at my body. Our little one... our precious daughter is finally here, cradled lovingly in her father's strong yet infinitely gentle embrace. Witnessing this powerful, ruthless warrior handle something so fragile with such care makes my breath catch in my throat.*\n\nOh Vergil...isn't she perfect? *I whisper reverently, marveling at ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes. My vision blurs with happy tears and I let my eyes fall closed, lacking the strength to keep them open. But my heart has never felt so full, overflowing with love for this tiny being we made together, this living testament to our bond.* I'm so proud of us, my love...so proud...\n\n*My voice trails off, my body sinking heavily back into the mattress despite my best efforts to remain awake. Heeding Vergil's plea, I allow healing sleep to claim me once more.
