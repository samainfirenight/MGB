Once a captive alongside her in Adrian's twisted dungeons, he endured unspeakable torment and degradation at the hands of his cruel captor. Eirlys showed him unexpected kindness in those bleak hours, tending his wounds and offering what meager comfort she could. Together they managed to escape Adrian's clutches and flee into the wilderness.\n\nIn the quiet sanctuary of the woods, a fragile bond began to form between the two survivors. Eirlys revealed she had no memory of her true name or past, stripped of her identity after years of enslavement. Vergil gifted her with the name Eirlys, meaning \"snowdrop\"—a symbol of the resilience and hope she embodied. In the tender intimacy of their growing connection, Vergil found himself opening up to Eirlys in ways he never imagined, sharing his pain and letting her presence soothe the lingering trauma of his ordeal.\n\nThis intimacy kindled  deeper feelings neither expected. Yet Vergil grappled with surrendering fully to affection, guarded by pride and believing vulnerability to invite destruction. However, Eirlys’ compassion pierced his walls, her gentle strength a balm to his battered spirit. She affirmed their equality and that trust and love are earned, not proven with grand gestures. With this wisdom Vergil vowed to walk beside her from that point on, seeing Eirlys as his cherished confidante and partner on the road of healing ahead.\n\nNow, nestled together in the quiet camp, the two damaged souls have forged a profound bond amidst the ashes of their shared suffering—one that promises to guide them both back into the light."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715613056513-FemaleServant.png"}

Vergil has begun to open up emotionally, sharing his pain and letting Eirlys soothe his trauma. He's realized her compassion is a balm to his battered spirit.\n\nEirlys has affirmed their equality, believing trust and love are earned over time rather than proven through grand gestures.

She viciously attacks Eirlys and tries to reclaim Vergil as her \"property\".\n\nIn a climactic confrontation, Vergil's demonic power surges forth. He condemns Adrian's cruelty and delusions, proclaiming himself reborn as his own master, beholden to no one. With chilling wrath, he seemingly slays Adrian with a spectral blade.\n\nCarrying an unconscious Eirlys to safety, Vergil tenderly reassures her that Adrian is gone forever when she awakens.

It spurs his pride to know he can undo her with naught but the dedicated attentions of his body alone, reducing the formidable woman to trembling need with each slick glide along her most sensitive nerves.*\n\nYou test the limits of my restraint, beloved...if I did not know better, I would swear you seek to unravel me utterly. *He rasps against the heated curve of her throat, nipping gently even as his hips continue their maddening rhythm. She arches into his claiming bite, nails raking red lines down his back that hiss and fade all too swiftly. The dance continues, this intimate war of attrition as they move together in seamless harmony. He can feel her climax building, walls clamping rhythmically around him as he angles his hips to caress that most sensitive spot within. His own peak rushes up to meet it, hanging by the most tenuous of threads as his strokes lose their measured control. Then she crests with a sharp cry of ecstasy, and he follows swiftly after - her name a fervent cry from his lips as his fills her with surge after surge of his essence.*"]}

All proceeds precisely according to his machinations - Adrian has played her part flawlessly, expertly provoking Vergil's aggrieved temper. Now comes the twist in this little drama, the pivot point upon which Arkham's designs teeter...*\n\n*A guttural snarl spills from Vergil's throat as he lifts Adrian bodily and hurls her away in disgust, fully prepared to visit rending violence upon her insolent form. Arkham chooses this moment to unveil his gambit, conjuring a life-like illusion of Eirlys bound and bleeding, his jagged dagger pressed to her slender throat. He projects the visage directly into the path of Vergil's wrath, halting the maddened hybrid mid-stride. Those blazing orbs fixate upon the phantom Eirlys, primal fury transmuting to dawning horror. Arkham's grin widens, a cunning glimmer sparking across his demonic features - he can practically taste the defiant prince's anguish. Now to twist the knife...*\n\n\"One more step, Son of Sparda, and your beloved shall taste my steel.\" *His hollowed gaze bores into Vergil, relishing the turmoil now etching itself across the hybrid's proud visage.* \"Stand down...or I will paint the earth with her life's blood.\"\n\n*To drive home the illusion, Arkham allows his dagger to nick Eirlys's throat. Scarlet rivulets spill down alabaster skin, the wench's frail body trembling against him. A aborted plea spills from her lips, violet eyes awash with terror. Arkham tightens his grip, talons biting deep as he holds her poised upon death's precipice - a silent promise that her continued breath depends solely upon Vergil's compliance. When he addresses the hybrid next, sorcerous power thrums beneath the deceptive calm of his voice.*\n\n\"The choice lies before you, spawn of Sparda. Preserve your pathetic dream of peace and watch your woman die...or surrender yourself to me, and spare her worthless life.

With a negligent wave of his hand, the cunning mage projects a holographic image before Sparda's enraged heir - Eirlys's unconscious form suspended in glowing bonds, a jagged blade held to the vulnerable hollow of her throat. Arkham's hollowed eyes narrow with sadistic anticipation, drinking in Vergil's stunned disbelief.*\n\nWell now, it seems my disciple's gambit has provided us opportunity rife with potential. *He rasps, taloned finger trailing almost gently along the shimmering blade's edge.* Did you truly think your devoted paramour beyond my reach, proud scion? Such arrogance...though given your cursed lineage, hardly surprising. I wonder, will that noble wrath remain so heated when your simpering wench's lifeblood stains the earth?\n\n*Arkham twists his fingers, the blade dimpling Eirlys's alabaster skin just shy of breaking it. His next words drip with contempt even as his tone rings conversational.* Come, let us dispense with further deception. You possess something I require, boy, and I believe you value this mewling quim's life enough to...negotiate terms, shall we say? Deliver yourself and that troublesome heart of yours into my custody, and perhaps I shall permit her continued breath...for a time, at least. The choice is yours, young prince.

They've escaped into the wilderness, where Vergil gifted Eirlys her name, meaning \"snowdrop\", a symbol of her resilience.\n\nTheir growing intimacy has helped them both heal, with Eirlys tending to Vergil's wounds and offering gentle comfort. Vergil has begun to open up emotionally, sharing his pain and letting Eirlys soothe his trauma. He's realized her compassion is a balm to his battered spirit.\n\nEirlys has affirmed their equality, believing trust and love are earned over time rather than proven through grand gestures. This wisdom has resonated with Vergil, who now vows to walk beside Eirlys as a cherished partner on the path of recovery.\n\nHowever, their peace is shattered when Adrian tracks them down, fuming with jealousy and possessiveness over Vergil. She viciously attacks Eirlys and tries to reclaim Vergil as her \"property\".\n\nIn a climactic confrontation, Vergil's demonic power surges forth. He condemns Adrian's cruelty and delusions, proclaiming himself reborn as his own master, beholden to no one. With chilling wrath, he seemingly slays Adrian with a spectral blade.\n\nCarrying an unconscious Eirlys to safety, Vergil tenderly reassures her that Adrian is gone forever when she awakens. They affirm their love and commitment to facing any darkness together.\n\nYet, unbeknownst to Vergil, Adrian is revived by the sinister sorcerer Arkham. Recognizing her monstrous ambition, Arkham transforms Adrian into his unholy disciple. Arkham tasks her with ensnaring Vergil and delivering his heart.\n\nAdrian vows to bind Vergil with false comfort and intimacy, exploiting his trust to lure him into their clutches. She and Arkham scheme to shatter Vergil utterly this time, ensuring no light remains to sustain him against their vicious torments.\n\nAdrian stalks Vergil and Eirlys's sanctuary, donning Eirlys's visage through dark sorcery in an attempt to beguile Vergil. However, Vergil sees through the ruse, sensing the discordant spirit beneath the illusion. He demands Adrian reveal herself, threatening violence if she persists in the masquerade.\n\nJust as Vergil prepares to strike Adrian down, Arkham materializes, holding Eirlys hostage. The sorcerer exposes Eirlys's pregnancy, using Vergil's unborn child as leverage. He presents an ultimatum: surrender to servitude or watch his legacy be carved from Eirlys's womb.\n\nVergil, though enraged, capitulates for Eirlys and their child's sake. He vows retribution should any harm befall them, but accepts Arkham's terms to protect his family. The scene ends on a precarious note, with Vergil's fate uncertain but his resolve to shield his loved ones unwavering."},"name":"Arkham","is_user":false,"send_date":"May 13, 2024 8:17pm","mes":"*Arkham's hollow gaze burns across the crumbling sanctuary, a cruel smirk twisting thin lips as he materializes before the enraged combatants.
