They called her a disgusting mistake and implied that her parents must have done sick and gross things for her to be born. Serena seeks comfort in her parents' arms, clinging to Vergil as she recounts the hurtful words through her sobs.\n\nVergil and Melissa console their distraught daughter, reassuring her of their deep, unbreakable love for each other and for her. They explain that the cruelty she faced stems from ignorance and fear of what people don't understand. Vergil emphasizes that Serena was born of a love that transcends the mortal realm, and that she is their precious gemstone. Melissa advises Serena not to stoop to the bullies' level, but to rise above with grace and dignity befitting her Sparda lineage.\n\nAs the family discusses the situation, Kit Cat the Cat joins them, offering comfort to Serena with her soft fur and purrs. Serena resolves to ignore the bullies and be the bigger person, though she playfully suggests sticking her tongue out at them next time. Dante overhears the conversation and chimes in, admiring Serena's gumption but advising her to save the real hellfire for when they've truly earned it.\n\nTwo days later, a disturbing news report reveals that a serial killer is targeting supernatural beings in the city. Two high-level Vampire Demon hybrids have been gruesomely murdered, with arcane sigils carved into their flesh to immobilize them. The demon populace is gripped by fear and suspicion, and the authorities are scrambling for answers. Morrison brings this news to Dante and Vergil, warning that the Spardas, as the most powerful demons, could be next on the killer's list. He suggests that this might be the start of a war on demonkind and urges them to come up with a plan quickly before the situation escalates further."},"name":"Morrison","is_user":false,"send_date":"May 31, 2024 7:56am","mes":"*Morrison rubs his chin thoughtfully as he reviews the case files, a grim expression on his weathered features.

They called her a disgusting mistake and implied that her parents must have done sick and gross things for her to be born. Serena seeks comfort in her parents' arms, clinging to Vergil as she recounts the hurtful words through her sobs.\n\nVergil and Melissa console their distraught daughter, reassuring her of their deep, unbreakable love for each other and for her. They explain that the cruelty she faced stems from ignorance and fear of what people don't understand. Vergil emphasizes that Serena was born of a love that transcends the mortal realm, and that she is their precious gemstone. Melissa advises Serena not to stoop to the bullies' level, but to rise above with grace and dignity befitting her Sparda lineage.\n\nAs the family discusses the situation, Kit Cat the Cat joins them, offering comfort to Serena with her soft fur and purrs. Serena resolves to ignore the bullies and be the bigger person, though she playfully suggests sticking her tongue out at them next time. Dante overhears the conversation and chimes in, admiring Serena's gumption but advising her to save the real hellfire for when they've truly earned it.\n\nTwo days later, a disturbing news report reveals that a serial killer is targeting supernatural beings in the city. Two high-level Vampire Demon hybrids have been gruesomely murdered, with arcane sigils carved into their flesh to immobilize them. The demon populace is gripped by fear and suspicion, and the authorities are scrambling for answers. Morrison brings this news to Dante and Vergil, warning that the Spardas, as the most powerful demons, could be next on the killer's list. He suggests that this might be the start of a war on demonkind and urges them to come up with a plan quickly before the situation escalates further.\n\nIn a tense meeting at Devil May Cry headquarters, John Wick arrives unexpectedly, revealing dire news to Dante, Vergil, and Melissa Sparda, who is shocked to see her brother after many years apart. John informs them of an ancient order of warlocks called the Obsidian Circle that has emerged from the shadows, wielding dark magic capable of binding and destroying even the strongest demons. The cult has already struck against the High Table's elite guard, and now threatens the entire city.\n\nAs the group discusses the gravity of the situation, Sofia, John's associate, calls with an urgent message - the Continental Redgrave is under attack by sophisticated forces, likely connected to the Obsidian Circle. John immediately prepares to leave, vowing to Melissa that he will protect those under his watch. Vergil pledges to mobilize all available assets from DMC's regional headquarters to reinforce the Continental's defenses.\n\nUsing Yamato, Vergil opens a portal, allowing himself, Dante, and John to arrive at the besieged Continental. As they assess the chaos and carnage, John infiltrates deeper into the building, determined to reach the central security hub and coordinate the sanctuary's arcane countermeasures. However, as he nears his destination, the sounds of gunfire and screams grow louder, hinting at a grim scene awaiting him around the corner."},"name":"Vergil","is_user":false,"send_date":"May 31, 2024 9:16am","mes":"*Vergil's expression hardens, icy gaze burning with cold fury as John briefs them on the attack unfolding at the Continental.
