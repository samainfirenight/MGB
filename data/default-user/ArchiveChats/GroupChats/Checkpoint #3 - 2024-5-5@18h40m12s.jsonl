In this moment, there is no world beyond the sanctuary of their bed, no reality but the perfect union of their love.*\n\n*As their breathing slowly returns to normal, Vergil gathers Melissa close, cradling her against his chest as if she were the most precious thing in the universe. And to him, she is. His heart, his soul, his very reason for being.*\n\nI love you, Melissa, *he whispers into the silence.*"]}

They recently welcomed their daughter Serena, enriching their family life and deepening their bond.\n\nVergil, managing both his duties at Devil May Cry and his role as a husband and father, maintains regular contact with Dante, his brother, to keep informed about the office’s status. The company is undergoing significant expansion, and despite being on extended maternity leave, both Vergil and Melissa stay updated on the developments, demonstrating their dedication to their professional and familial responsibilities.\n\nTheir home life is highlighted by moments of intimate family interactions, such as Vergil waking Melissa in a tender and loving manner by kissing her most intimate place, demonstrating his deep affection and reverence for her. This act of devotion leads to a passionate exchange between them, where mutual expressions of love are shared. They engage in a physically intimate interaction, which is described in detail, highlighting their strong emotional and physical connection.\n\nLater, Vergil prepares breakfast and suggests they eat outside to enjoy the morning together, which underscores their harmony and mutual support. Melissa is appreciative of Vergil's efforts in balancing their complex lives, and they maintain a strong, supportive partnership, always looking out for one another's well-being.\n\nRecently, they planned to host Nero and Kyrie for dinner, aiming to strengthen family bonds and integrate Nero further into the strategic discussions of Devil May Cry. This reflects their ongoing efforts to balance professional responsibilities with nurturing their family relationships.\n\nVergil and Melissa's relationship is characterized by mutual respect and affection. Melissa supports Vergil in his dual roles as a businessman and family man, appreciating his efforts and encouraging him to take time for relaxation. Vergil values Melissa's insights and acknowledges her as an equal partner in managing both their family and business affairs. They are preparing for a family dinner with Nero and Kyrie, seeing it as an opportunity to reinforce family ties and involve Nero more in the decision-making processes of Devil May Cry.\n\nNero has been offered an important promotion by his father, Vergil, to take on a leadership role coordinating recruitment and special forces training for Devil May Cry's new West Coast bases. This will involve stepping up to guide strategic growth and operations in the region. Nero initially expresses surprise, but quickly shows his readiness to take on the burden and responsibility.\n\nVergil affirms his confidence in Nero's growth and capabilities to handle this role. Melissa likewise expresses her faith in Nero, and informs him that the promotion has already been made officially with Dante's approval. Nero will need to participate in corporate meetings and provide reports on his regional efforts.\n\nVergil advises Nero that in one week, detailed plans and resources for implementing this new leadership mandate will be provided. Nero must begin attending directors' strategy meetings remotely. Vergil stresses the isolation and gravity of leadership, advising Nero to cherish connections with loved ones.\n\nKyrie emotionally embraces Nero, affirming her steadfast pride and support despite the trials ahead. She vows to remain by his side and build a sanctuary for them no darkness can breach. Nero promises not to forget what matters most - his love for her.\n\nWith resolute determination, Nero meets Vergil's gaze and asserts his readiness to make plans for this new role.
