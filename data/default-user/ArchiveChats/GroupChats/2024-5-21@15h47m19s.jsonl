Instead, he holds her gaze for a few heartbeats longer, allowing the weight of her request to resonate between them like a tangible force. Only when he's certain they are of one mind does he give himself over to the depths of his desire.*\n\n*With a low, rumbling growl of pure masculine need, he shifts his weight forward, the thick ridge of his arousal parting her slick folds with exquisite ease. They both inhale sharply as the blunt head nudges against her entrance, twin expressions of rapture washing over their features at that first, electrifying point of contact.*\n\nSo perfect... *Vergil rasps against the slender column of Melissa's throat, his lips ghosting over her hammering pulse as he fights for composure.* You were made for me, my love... *His hips roll in one sinuous, unhurried motion, and he slides home in one achingly slow thrust.*\n\nNnnghhh... *The guttural groan that rumbles up from his chest is one of pure, unrestrained ecstasy as her velvet heat sheathes him to the hilt. His fingers tangle in her tresses, holding her immobile as he simply revels in the feeling of being so intimately joined - a perfect, seamless union of flesh and spirit.*\n\n*For long, indulgent moments, he remains like that, buried to the hilt and savoring the exquisite friction of her inner walls fluttering around his throbbing length. He nuzzles against the curve of her neck, his lips brushing over her feverishly warm skin in a series of reverent, openmouthed kisses. His free hand roams the expanse of her body in an achingly tender caress, mapping every dip and swell as if committing her to memory through touch alone.*\n\n*Only when the smoldering coals of his need flare into an inferno once more does he finally move, withdrawing in one torturously slow glide until just the broad head of his arousal remains sheathed within her molten depths. He holds that position for the space of a heartbeat, the thick ridge catching deliciously on her inner muscles before surging forward once more with a sharp roll of his hips.*\n\nAaahhh... *The harsh exhalation ghosts over Melissa's lips as Vergil claims her fully, their bodies melding together in that most primal and intimate of embraces. His movements are languid yet purposeful, each rolling thrust calibrated to reach those deepest, most sensitive places within her. His lips blaze a scorching path across her jawline, her cheeks, her brow - paying reverent homage to every inch of her beauty as their bodies move in an ageless rhythm.*\n\n*Though his pace remains unhurried, there is a steadily mounting intensity behind each sinuous undulation of his hips - a gathering storm that Melissa can feel in the minute tremors rippling through his musculature, the slight catch of his breath, the almost imperceptible tightening of his fingers against her scalp and hip. The coil of tension within him grows taut, threatening to snap with each delicious drag of her inner walls against his throbbing length.*\n\n*And still he holds himself in check, refusing to simply take what his body so desperately craves. Instead, he makes a feast of her, savoring every gasped whimper, every arch and shudder of pure bliss as he slowly, inexorably drives them both towards the brink of rapture. His eyes remain locked on hers throughout, twin azure depths swirling with a tumult of emotion - adoration, hunger, need, and something far deeper that resonates between them with every joined breath.*\n\n*Only when he feels her inner muscles beginning to flutter in those telltale contractions does he finally increase his tempo, shifting to long, powerful strokes that drive to her deepest core. His fingers tighten in her hair, tilting her head back to expose the slender line of her throat as his lips blaze a scorching path over her racing pulse.* Let go, my love... *The words are a low, rumbling rasp against her fevered skin, his breath hot and ragged with barely restrained need.* Give yourself over to me... Let me take you to that blissful edge and beyond...\n\n*Punctuating his ardent plea, he snaps his hips forward in a series of sharp, targeted thrusts, each one angled to brush against that one exquisitely sensitive place. His free hand slides down to where their bodies are joined, the pads of his fingers unerringly seeking out her throbbing pearl.

Instead, he holds her gaze for a few heartbeats longer, allowing the weight of her request to resonate between them like a tangible force. Only when he's certain they are of one mind does he give himself over to the depths of his desire.*\n\n*With a low, rumbling growl of pure masculine need, he shifts his weight forward, the thick ridge of his arousal parting her slick folds with exquisite ease. They both inhale sharply as the blunt head nudges against her entrance, twin expressions of rapture washing over their features at that first, electrifying point of contact.*\n\nSo perfect... *Vergil rasps against the slender column of Melissa's throat, his lips ghosting over her hammering pulse as he fights for composure.* You were made for me, my love... *His hips roll in one sinuous, unhurried motion, and he slides home in one achingly slow thrust.*\n\nNnnghhh... *The guttural groan that rumbles up from his chest is one of pure, unrestrained ecstasy as her velvet heat sheathes him to the hilt. His fingers tangle in her tresses, holding her immobile as he simply revels in the feeling of being so intimately joined - a perfect, seamless union of flesh and spirit.*\n\n*For long, indulgent moments, he remains like that, buried to the hilt and savoring the exquisite friction of her inner walls fluttering around his throbbing length. He nuzzles against the curve of her neck, his lips brushing over her feverishly warm skin in a series of reverent, openmouthed kisses. His free hand roams the expanse of her body in an achingly tender caress, mapping every dip and swell as if committing her to memory through touch alone.*\n\n*Only when the smoldering coals of his need flare into an inferno once more does he finally move, withdrawing in one torturously slow glide until just the broad head of his arousal remains sheathed within her molten depths. He holds that position for the space of a heartbeat, the thick ridge catching deliciously on her inner muscles before surging forward once more with a sharp roll of his hips.*\n\nAaahhh... *The harsh exhalation ghosts over Melissa's lips as Vergil claims her fully, their bodies melding together in that most primal and intimate of embraces. His movements are languid yet purposeful, each rolling thrust calibrated to reach those deepest, most sensitive places within her. His lips blaze a scorching path across her jawline, her cheeks, her brow - paying reverent homage to every inch of her beauty as their bodies move in an ageless rhythm.*\n\n*Though his pace remains unhurried, there is a steadily mounting intensity behind each sinuous undulation of his hips - a gathering storm that Melissa can feel in the minute tremors rippling through his musculature, the slight catch of his breath, the almost imperceptible tightening of his fingers against her scalp and hip. The coil of tension within him grows taut, threatening to snap with each delicious drag of her inner walls against his throbbing length.*\n\n*And still he holds himself in check, refusing to simply take what his body so desperately craves. Instead, he makes a feast of her, savoring every gasped whimper, every arch and shudder of pure bliss as he slowly, inexorably drives them both towards the brink of rapture. His eyes remain locked on hers throughout, twin azure depths swirling with a tumult of emotion - adoration, hunger, need, and something far deeper that resonates between them with every joined breath.*\n\n*Only when he feels her inner muscles beginning to flutter in those telltale contractions does he finally increase his tempo, shifting to long, powerful strokes that drive to her deepest core. His fingers tighten in her hair, tilting her head back to expose the slender line of her throat as his lips blaze a scorching path over her racing pulse.* Let go, my love... *The words are a low, rumbling rasp against her fevered skin, his breath hot and ragged with barely restrained need.* Give yourself over to me... Let me take you to that blissful edge and beyond...\n\n*Punctuating his ardent plea, he snaps his hips forward in a series of sharp, targeted thrusts, each one angled to brush against that one exquisitely sensitive place. His free hand slides down to where their bodies are joined, the pads of his fingers unerringly seeking out her throbbing pearl. With deft circular strokes, he works her swollen bud in perfect counterpoint to the sinuous undulations of his hips, driving her relentlessly towards that shimmering precipice.*\n\n*He can feel her walls beginning to flutter and clench with each powerful surge of his hips, her back arching sharply as the first tremors of release crest over her.
