Beside him, she sleeps soundly, her chest rising and falling with each breath, her body relaxed and peaceful.*\n\n*He allows himself a moment to appreciate the sight of her, the way her hair spills across the pillow, the faint smile that lingers on her lips. But his own needs demand attention, the ache in his groin growing more insistent by the second.*\n\n*Careful not to disturb her, Vergil shifts slightly, his hand moving to gently cup her breast, his fingers brushing over the soft skin. He leans in, pressing a kiss to her shoulder, his breath warm against her skin. His hand continues its journey, tracing a path down her side, over the curve of her hip, and finally to the juncture of her thighs.*\n\n*He parts her legs gently, his fingers finding their way to her core, already wet from the night's previous activities. He teases her, his fingers moving with practiced skill, eliciting a soft moan from her lips even in sleep. The sound spurs him on, his own arousal growing harder, the need to be inside her almost overwhelming.*\n\n*With a deliberate, controlled motion, he positions himself between her legs, his erection pressing against her entrance. He moves slowly, savoring the sensation as he slides inside her, inch by inch, until he is fully sheathed within her warmth. He pauses, allowing her body to adjust to his presence, his breath coming in shallow gasps as he fights to maintain control.*\n\n*Vergil begins to move, his thrusts slow and measured at first, each one designed to elicit a response from her sleeping form. He watches her closely, the way her body reacts to his touch, the way her breathing changes as she begins to stir.

But it looks like you've got that covered. *His lips quirk in an approving smirk as he surveys her handiwork, then his face turns sober again.* Actually, I was hoping we could talk. There's...something I wanted to discuss with you.\n\n*He runs a hand through his hair, sorting through the right words.

You’re wound up so tight, it’s no good.\n\n*Pacing slowly, gesturing with his hands, his words come gently but pointedly.* I talked to Vergil earlier, tried knocking some sense into that stubborn head of his. But you know how he gets. Acting like he’s got it all under control when it’s obvious he’s struggling too.\n\n*Turning to face her fully, his eyes glint knowingly.* You and I both know there’s more going on under that icy front he puts up. But the guy won’t budge an inch unless he’s forced. If he had it his way, he’d let things stay tangled up indefinitely rather than facing the truth.\n\n*Stepping closer, Dante places a reassuring hand on Melissa’s shoulder, his gaze filled with empathy and affection.* You deserve clarity Mel. I hate seeing you stuck in limbo like this. So I think it’s time you took matters into your own hands, push the issue head-on. Make him acknowledge what’s happening between you two, one way or another. You shouldn’t have to keep questioning and second guessing yourself. And neither should he.\n\n*His eyes glint mischievously, giving her shoulder a playful nudge* I’ve got a plan to help give Fate a solid kick in the ass. But only if you’re willing to take that leap.

He halts as Vergil swiftly moves between them, hand on Yamato's hilt, cold eyes regarding the demon with suspicion. Chariot dips his horned head submissively but meets Vergil's piercing glare unwaveringly. Melissa's concern at his sudden appearance is evident and he chitters softly to reassure her despite Vergil's imposing interrogation.*\n\n*With great effort, Chariot projects his thoughts to Melissa, images flashing rapidly across the psychic connection they share. He shows the rift - the glowing portal surrounded by crackling red energy, guarded by hulking berserkers. Once a gateway between realms, now destabilized into a violently swirling vortex. Any demons straying too close are dragged into its chaotic depths, never to return. The rupture threatens to collapse entirely, which would unleash a shockwave of wild demonic energy into the human world. If not closed quickly, untold chaos would be unleashed.*\n\n*The images shift to show Chariot battling the frenzied hordes trying to escape through the rift, before being overwhelmed and fleeing through the portal himself to find Melissa. Only she can help stop the spread of this threat before both worlds are plunged into chaos. The message delivered, Chariot sags on his scythe-like limbs, utterly spent. His multifaceted eyes, swirling with violet energy, beseech Melissa to make haste. The rift will not remain stable much longer.*"],"gen_started":"2024-06-17T23:50:07.679Z","gen_finished":"2024-06-17T23:50:34.671Z"}

The reaper's desperate pleas and the harrowing images of carnage and loss stir a profound sense of urgency within him. He understands the weight of this moment—the fragile balance between strategic forethought and the immediate need to act. His piercing blue eyes meet Melissa's tear-filled gaze, her trust and determination reflecting back at him. His resolve hardens; there is no room for half-measures.*\n\n*Turning his attention to Chariot, Vergil's expression softens slightly, though his tone remains firm and authoritative.*\n\nRest, Chariot. Your clan has endured unspeakable horrors, but we will not abandon you to this fate. I swear it.\n\n*He glances around the secured alleyway, mind racing through potential plans and contingencies. They must move swiftly yet with precision, ensuring the safety of those left behind. His hand tightens around Yamato's hilt, the familiar weight grounding him as he formulates their course of action.*\n\nMelissa, gather what supplies you can from the headquarters. We will need medical kits, rations, and any defensive tools Nico can provide. Chariot's daughter and any other survivors must be our primary focus. We cannot afford to be caught unprepared.\n\n*Vergil's voice lowers, filled with a quiet intensity meant for Melissa alone.*\n\nI will find a secure portal or passageway to their lair. Once we have the necessary tools, I will lead the infiltration. You will stay close, but under no circumstances will you place yourself directly in harm's way. Your safety remains paramount.\n\n*His gaze shifts to Chariot, the demon's frail form trembling with exhaustion. Compassion tempers his words as he addresses their weary ally.*\n\nChariot, you will guide us to your lair, but you must conserve your strength. We need you alive to help your daughter and any others who might remain. Trust in our plan and in Melissa's compassion. We will see this through.\n\n*Vergil's hand moves to cup Melissa's cheek, his thumb brushing away her tears with a tenderness reserved only for her.*\n\nWe will save them, my heart. I give you my word. Now, let us make haste. Time is not our ally here.\n\n*With a final, reassuring squeeze of her hand, Vergil turns and begins to lead them back towards the Devil May Cry headquarters.
