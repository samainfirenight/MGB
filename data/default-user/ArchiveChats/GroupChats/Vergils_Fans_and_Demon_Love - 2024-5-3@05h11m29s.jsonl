When at last he reaches the precipice, it is with your name torn from his throat in a resonant shout, his essence flooding into you in heated pulses.*\n\n*In the aftermath, he holds you close through the last shudders wracking his frame, waiting until the fires bank to glowing embers. Gently disengaging, he bears you down to the cool floor, cradling you atop him so no chill can touch your flushed skin. One clawed hand trails lazily up and down your back as the other tilts your chin up, thumb caressing soft skin.*\n\nMy radiant goddess, *he murmurs, eyes burning with affectionate fire,* in our shared passion, I find purpose and belonging.

Growling his satisfaction, Vergil sets a relentless pace - his driving length spearing into her tight slick depths over and over. One hand braces white-knuckled against the headboard while the other remains fisted in her hair, using the grip as leverage to pull her back hard against each pounding thrust. The new angle drives him impossibly deeper, grinding against that hidden sweet spot within. Already he can feel her inner walls fluttering, gripping him tightly as climax races nearer...*\n\nSing for me beloved! Cry your ecstasy aloud so the very heavens shake! For I shall use you thoroughly until naught remains save our mingled cries amidst rapturous ruin..."]}

The burden of my choices etched into every line of my face, the weight of my regrets bearing down like a physical force.\n\n*He turns to Melissa, a sad smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.* It's a poignant encapsulation of my journey, is it not? The innocence lost, the bond shattered, the scars that linger still. An entire lifetime of love and loss, distilled into a few fleeting frames.\n\n*Vergil reaches out to take Melissa's hand, lacing their fingers together in a gesture of quiet comfort.* And yet, for all the sorrow it depicts...I find a strange solace in this tribute. To know that others see beneath the surface, that they recognize the depth of feeling behind each choice and consequence...it makes the burden easier to bear, somehow.\n\n*He lifts their joined hands, brushing a soft kiss across her knuckles.* Thank you for sharing this with me, beloved. For helping me see the beauty in the brokenness, the meaning in the melancholy. With you by my side, I feel strong enough to face the ghosts of my past...and perhaps, in time, to lay them to rest at last.","gen_started":"2024-05-03T10:41:14.115Z","gen_finished":"2024-05-03T10:42:08.743Z","force_avatar":"/thumbnail?type=avatar&file=Vergil_2.png","original_avatar":"Vergil_2.png","swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 3, 2024 6:41am","gen_started":"2024-05-03T10:41:14.115Z","gen_finished":"2024-05-03T10:42:08.743Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-opus-20240229","gen_id":1714732874114}}],"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Vergil studies the collage once more, eyes narrowing in concentration as he pieces together the fragmented narrative.

I'm sorry, my darling, there's always a bit of trial and error where limitations of technology are concerned, but give me a few moments and I will try to put an individual set of images, that I can show you, and maybe you can get a clearer view of what's being told in the tribute to you.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1712831396689-Melissa.png"}
