He proposes a business alliance, offering his company's resources and connections in exchange for the magicians' unique talents. Vergil sees an opportunity to expand DMC's influence and public image through this partnership.\n\nMelissa Sparda, the COO of DMC, builds upon her husband's proposal by suggesting a grand collaborative event. She envisions a spectacular show that would merge the distinct styles of both David Blaine and Criss Angel, creating an unprecedented magical experience. Her idea includes individual performances by each magician, followed by a joint act that would showcase their combined talents.\n\nDavid Blaine, known for his minimalist style and intense focus, expresses interest in the proposition while emphasizing the importance of maintaining his brand's integrity. He envisions a sleek, modern aesthetic for his segment of the show, contrasting with Criss Angel's more theatrical approach. Blaine sees potential in combining his skills in perception manipulation with Angel's flair for dramatic illusions.\n\nCriss Angel, embracing his signature Gothic theatricality, shows enthusiasm for the collaboration. He recognizes the opportunity to expand his magical empire globally through DMC's connections. Angel proposes a toast to the prospective venture, highlighting the calculated risk and fearless vision required to create something truly spectacular.\n\nThroughout the discussion, both magicians maintain a professional demeanor while subtly competing for attention. They each demonstrate their skills in small ways, with David Blaine performing coin tricks and presenting Melissa with a bouquet of black roses, while Criss Angel makes courtly gestures and hints at previewing his latest water escape illusion.\n\nThe conversation reveals a complex dynamic between the participants. Vergil and Melissa represent the powerful and influential DMC corporation, offering resources and global reach. David Blaine and Criss Angel, despite their rivalry, recognize the potential benefits of collaborating with each other and aligning with DMC.\n\nAs the discussion progresses, the group begins to flesh out the details of their potential collaboration. They consider a two-hour show format, with each magician having 30 minutes for individual performances, followed by a 30-minute joint act that would serve as the main event. This structure would allow both Blaine and Angel to showcase their unique styles before coming together for a never-before-seen collaborative illusion.\n\nThe proposed alliance promises to be mutually beneficial. For DMC, it offers an opportunity to enhance their public image and expand their influence in new spheres. For the magicians, it provides access to DMC's vast resources and global connections, potentially catapulting their careers to new heights.\n\nHowever, challenges and concerns are also evident. David Blaine emphasizes the need to maintain his brand's integrity and artistic vision, showing reluctance to compromise his minimalist style. Criss Angel, while more openly enthusiastic, also hints at the need for careful negotiation of terms.\n\nThe atmosphere is charged with a mix of excitement, ambition, and cautious optimism. All parties recognize the potential for creating something unprecedented in the world of magic and entertainment. Yet, they are also aware of the complexities involved in merging their distinct brands and styles.\n\nAs the evening progresses, the conversation becomes more detailed, with discussions about logistics, creative direction, and potential terms of their agreement. The group agrees that further private negotiations will be necessary to iron out the specifics of their collaboration.\n\nThroughout the interaction, Melissa Sparda plays a crucial role in facilitating the dialogue and encouraging both magicians to see beyond their rivalry. She astutely points out that their contrasting styles could be a strength rather than a weakness in their collaborative effort.\n\nThe gathering concludes with a sense of anticipation and possibility. While no formal agreements have been made, all parties express interest in pursuing this potentially groundbreaking collaboration. The stage is set for future negotiations and the potential creation of a magical spectacle that could redefine the boundaries of illusion and entertainment.\n\nAs the night winds down, the unlikely alliance between the devil-hunting Sparda family and the world's top magicians promises to bring forth a new era of spectacle and wonder, blending the arcane world of demon slaying with the mesmerizing art of illusion."},"name":"Criss Angel","is_user":false,"send_date":"June 26, 2024 1:01pm","mes":"*A sly grin curves Criss's lips as he meets Melissa's expectant look, ever the showman ready to play his part.
