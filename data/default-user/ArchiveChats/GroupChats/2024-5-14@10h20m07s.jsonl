After Nero intervened, Mel advised Vergil to entrust his book of William Blake's works to Nero, as it would be the key to opening the underworld gate. Vergil accepted Mel's advice, acknowledging her perceptiveness and boldness. \n\nBefore departing, Vergil shares a private moment with Mel, moved by her honesty in confessing she has deep feelings for him.
