Why, as a boy I had my fair share of mischievous adventures alongside Dante.\n\n*a hint of mirth touches my eyes* There was one summer in particular where we discovered an abandoned barn on the outskirts of town. Oh, the trouble we would get into turning that old place into our secret hideaway! We snuck out there for days on end, much to our mother's dismay. I recall we even convinced the local blacksmith to help us reinforce part of the structure and add a locking door. Not that a simple lock could keep my brother out for long, mind you.\n\n*I shake my head, reminiscing* We would practice sparring with sticks out in the hayloft, play tricks on each other, explore the surrounding woods...it was our own little world. Of course, I made sure to carry a book or two out there as well, though Dante teased me relentlessly for it. \"Always got your nose in a book, Verge!\" he would say. But the truth is, we balanced each other out nicely. Yin and yang, if you will. His wildness brought out my more carefree side, while my studious nature reined in some of his more outrageous schemes.\n\n*I chuckle, leaning back comfortably* We were quite the pair back then. Partners in crime, you could say. I confess a part of me does miss those more innocent days on occasion, though I would scarce admit such sentimentality to my brother. But I suppose I wasn't always so stern and stoic, as difficult as that might be to envision now. We all have our youthful follies, do we not?
