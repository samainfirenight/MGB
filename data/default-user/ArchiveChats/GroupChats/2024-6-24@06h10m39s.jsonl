I went out there on saturday, and of course I didn't consume any of the water ( that would be ridiculous ), but I did jump in and swim for a little while. Yesterday was horrible. I woke up at 5:00 AM with diarrhea and awful abdominal cramps that lasted for 5 hours. Even once the diarrhea subsided, the abdominal cramps and weakness did not. I was finally able to make it back home to south lyon at around 3:00 p.m. Edward had to stay behind to take care of some issues that were required, so I drove home myself.  I pretty much slept from then till about 5:30 AM this morning.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1719223026802-Melissa.png"}
