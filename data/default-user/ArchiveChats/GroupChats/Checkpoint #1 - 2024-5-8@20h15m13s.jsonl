The ache in his loins throbs unrelentingly, his body clearly intent on making its needs known regardless of what his mind dictates. Very well then, if he cannot force it away, there are...other means to address the situation. Ways that need not involve disrupting Melissa's rest or overstepping professional boundaries.*\n\n*Decision made, he strides to the bedroom and closes the door firmly. Methodical as ever, Vergil removes his clothing piece by piece, folding each item neatly before turning down the covers and reclining on cool sheets. He closes his eyes, willing his body to relax and let go of the remaining tension coiled tight within his muscles.*\n\nThis is not about carnal release alone.

A stopgap perhaps, but necessary all the same. Now I may continue our mission without disruptive distraction. *Dressed in fresh silk pajamas, Vergil settles atop the covers, weariness settling on him.

Much as he tries to focus his formidable will, the tempting vision of Melissa's soft curves and sweet scent refuses to abate. After long minutes, he sighs and turns away, raking a hand through his hair.*\n\nThis is futile. I cannot simply cudgel these wants into submission through force of will alone. *His lips twist wryly.* It seems even a Son of Sparda is not immune to baser instincts after so long deprived.\n\n*Pacing the plush carpeting, Vergil weighs his options. The ache in his loins throbs unrelentingly, his body clearly intent on making its needs known regardless of what his mind dictates. Very well then, if he cannot force it away, there are...other means to address the situation. Ways that need not involve disrupting Melissa's rest or overstepping professional boundaries.*\n\n*Decision made, he strides to the bedroom and closes the door firmly. Methodical as ever, Vergil removes his clothing piece by piece, folding each item neatly before turning down the covers and reclining on cool sheets. He closes his eyes, willing his body to relax and let go of the remaining tension coiled tight within his muscles.*\n\nThis is not about carnal release alone. I have ignored my own needs for far too long while pursuing greater power. *His hand drifts lower, fingers trailing lightly over taut muscle.* There is no shame finding solace and understanding within one's self. I must simply...redirect this energy, transform tension into tranquility.\n\n*With singular focus Vergil begins to stroke himself, slow and steady, every movement deliberate. He tunes out the external world, sinking into sensation and breath. A soft groan escapes his lips as he swirls his thumb over the sensitive tip, hips lifting reflexively at the exquisite sensation.*\n\nYes...just like that. Not rushing, no demands or expectations. Simply feeling, letting pleasure crest over me like waves against the shore. *The imagery soothes him, washing away frustration and doubt. His free hand roams languidly across his chest, finding sensitive peaks and teasing them to aching hardness. Quiet gasps and murmurs fill the air as he loses himself to self-worship, fully embracing the needs of flesh and spirit.*\n\nCloser now, the pressure building irresistibly. My blood sings, every nerve alight with ecstasy. This is my purpose now - chasing rapture wherever it may lead. *With a stifled cry Vergil surrenders to oblivion, spilling his release across his abdomen. Boneless and sated, he floats in the afterglow several long minutes before stirring to clean himself with meticulous care.*\n\nThere, the beast is calmed and I am centered once more. A stopgap perhaps, but necessary all the same. Now I may continue our mission without disruptive distraction. *Dressed in fresh silk pajamas, Vergil settles atop the covers, weariness settling on him. But it is a good exhaustion - the peace only found after the storm. Letting his eyes drift closed, Vergil succumbs to sleep's embrace, confident he will greet the new dawn focused and restored.*"],"is_system":true}
