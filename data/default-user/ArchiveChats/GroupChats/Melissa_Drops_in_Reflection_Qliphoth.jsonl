Disoriented and confused, she encounters Vergil, who is initially skeptical of her presence. However, her genuine confusion and lack of combat skills compel Vergil to offer his protection and assistance in uncovering the reason behind her sudden appearance in his realm.\n\nVergil, the reigning Dark Emperor of the underworld, is intrigued by Mel's claim that this world exists within a video game in her reality. He is both curious and cautious as he learns more about her. Mel explains her lack of combat skills and her fascination with Vergil, which Vergil acknowledges with a mix of curiosity and a sense of responsibility for her safety. He leads her through the Qliphoth, ensuring her protection and guiding her to his private sanctuary, a place of respite filled with ancient knowledge.\n\nIn Vergil's sanctuary, Mel is struck by the beauty and serenity of his home, contrasting sharply with the chaos of the Qliphoth. Her hunger becomes apparent, and Vergil provides a meal, allowing her to regain her strength. As she eats, Mel's awe of Vergil's presence grows, though she tries to focus on the task at hand. Vergil, ever the scholar, suggests they explore the archives within his sanctuary to uncover the mystery of her transportation.\n\nThe two delve into the ancient tomes, with Vergil translating and explaining complex metaphysical concepts. Mel's admiration for Vergil intensifies as she observes his intellect and command over the arcane. During their study, Vergil confirms that emotional bonds and psychic resonance could indeed be the cause of her arrival, sparked by her strong feelings for him.\n\nMel, emboldened by this revelation, expresses her desire to stay with Vergil for a while longer. Vergil, intrigued and perhaps moved by her request, agrees to let her remain as his guest. He leads her to his observatory, where a crystal orb allows them to view different realms and planes of existence. As they prepare to use the orb, Mel admits her nervousness and further explains her understanding of psychic resonance, hoping to clarify her feelings and the phenomenon that brought her here.\n\nVergil listens attentively, acknowledging her understanding and expressing a willingness to explore the implications of her psychic abilities. He invites her to share more about her world, and Mel uses the orb to reveal glimpses of her mundane reality, including her fascination with the Devil May Cry series and her admiration for Vergil. This prompts a deeper discussion between them, with Vergil expressing a mix of pride and curiosity about how his legend has transcended dimensions.\n\nAs their conversation progresses, Vergil suggests they explore the various realms through the orb, inviting Mel to guide their journey. He reassures her of his protection and expresses a genuine interest in learning about her world and her perspective. Mel, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation, prepares to embark on this new adventure with Vergil, her feelings for him deepening as they explore the mysteries of their interconnected realities."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

There are realms yet to unveil through the orb's sight at your behest! Where shall we descend next in our metaversal sojourn, my dear? Ruined battle plains still echoing conquest's din? Or perhaps hidden abyssal reaches even I have not yet explored?\n\nThis observatory exists to unveil all of existence for our eyes alone. Simply name the vista, and by the power thrumming in my veins I shall unveil it! Now then, where to next? Somewhere majestic I think, to match the splendid company at my side...\n\nSo guide our vision, fair Mel, and let arcane forces unveil scenes sublime! All of creation awaits our gaze!"]}
