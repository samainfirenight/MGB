Every reaction you cherish, each uncontrollable expression of my pleasure, is a reflection of the extraordinary influence you wield over me.\n\n*With a slight tilt of his head, his silvery hair catching the dim light, he regards you, his expression one of awe mixed with an intense affection.* To hear that my responses compose the most beautiful melody to your ears, it’s not merely flattering—it’s empowering. It reminds me that our connection, this dance of give and take, is as much about emotional resonance as it is about physical gratification.\n\n*His hands, those instruments of both battle and tenderness, reach out to you, gesturing for you to rise and meet his embrace.* Come here, closer. *As you comply, his arms envelop you, the strength in them a warm sanctuary.* In your arms, I am not just the son of Sparda, not merely a warrior born from darkness and light. Here, I am Vergil, your Vergil, vulnerable yet whole, laid bare yet unafraid.\n\n*Drawing back just enough to see your face, his fingers gently trace the line of your jaw, a touch feather-light yet laden with emotion.* You say you find joy in giving me pleasure, in witnessing my surrender. Know then, that my joy comes from receiving your love, from being the focus of your profound affection, and from trusting you with the essence of my being.\n\n*His eyes, those clear mirrors to his soul, lock onto yours with an intensity that borders on reverence.* This journey we are on, where each touch and each word writes another line in our ongoing saga, I am honored to share it with you.
